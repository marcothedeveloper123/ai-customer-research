MODERATOR: Now I would like to know more about your AI usage habits and in what aspects the current tools do not meet your expectations...

*Q4*
MODERATOR: What are the most common types of personal tasks for which you use AI? Tell me some examples.
PARTICIPANT: I usually use it more to ask for recipes or look up a term I don't know, search for a product that I know might be sold on Amazon in another country, but not in Argentina. I try to see if they sell it in Argentina on some website. The same if I see a product on TikTok or YouTube that interests me, but it's a video in English, for example, I try to find a substitute here in Argentina and ask for ideas on where I can find it or direct links. What else? I already mentioned recipes, sometimes to translate something into English or Spanish. I think that's mostly it. Once I asked for a knitting pattern, I like to knit and crochet, and I asked it to help me create a sweater pattern. It didn't work very well, but it was useful to get ideas on what colors I could combine.

MODERATOR: You mentioned you used AI for knitting patterns but it didn't work well. What specific problems did you have?
PARTICIPANT: The specific problem was that I asked for a pattern and thought it would write a well-detailed pattern with what to do per line, etc., but it didn't manage to do that. Maybe I wasn't very clear with the prompt, but it didn't manage to give me that. However, it did work well when I asked it to help me choose colors, to see which color matched with which or what colors from a pattern in a photo I had seen on Pinterest, where I could get similar colors that were all from the same yarn, let's say, the same brand and the same thickness. Another problem I had was that I asked it to help me calculate the amount of yarn I would need for a medium-sized sweater and it calculated too much yarn. Also, it's difficult to calculate that, but I ended up with double the yarn I needed.

MODERATOR: You mentioned several interesting uses - product search, recipes, translations. Are there other creative tasks besides knitting for which you have tried to use AI?
PARTICIPANT: Yes, recently I thought of starting a knitting podcast on YouTube, since here in Argentina there isn't much of that, but I do see it a lot in other countries, like in Europe. I follow some YouTubers from there and I liked the idea, so I used it to ask if there was any YouTuber in Argentina doing the same thing as me. We didn't find any, but it did give me ideas on how I could structure a video if I decide to do it at some point, with a kind of script and ideas on what I can talk about. It helped me analyze the videos of a particular YouTuber and made me create a kind of script on how I could divide the episode or the podcast.

*Q5*
MODERATOR: Tell me about an occasion when you wanted to use AI for something but couldn't. What was the task? What prevented you from using AI?
PARTICIPANT: I'm going to repeat a bit, but sometimes it doesn't work for me when I want to search or find a product to buy in Argentina. Many times it gives me links that lead nowhere or are not of the product I'm looking for, not even related. So I think that's it, and yes, I would say that.

MODERATOR: Could you give me a specific example of a product you tried to find and what problems you had exactly with the links the AI gave you?
PARTICIPANT: Yes, in particular, I remember that recently I found a pattern for a sweater that is from the United States or Europe, I don't remember the original country. There they suggest a brand of yarn and a thickness of yarn, but that brand is not sold here. I asked ChatGPT if it could give me substitutes that I could get in Argentina. The reality is that the substitutes it gave me did not correspond to the thickness of yarn I needed to replace. For that reason, I feel it didn't work for me. The same has happened to me wanting to buy circular needles here in Argentina to knit from a particular brand that I liked, which is sold abroad and not in Argentina. In Argentina, there are some yarn stores or haberdasheries that sell them, import them, and sell them. ChatGPT gave me the link to those, but it gave me links to products that were not in stock and that I was not going to be able to buy. I had clarified that please give me links to products that I could buy and it kept sending me the same links, so I feel it didn't work because of that.

*Q6*
MODERATOR: How much confidence do you have in the results or suggestions given by AI tools?

*Q7*
MODERATOR: Finally, I would like to know what your ideal AI assistant would be like...

*Q8*
MODERATOR: Imagine you have a perfect AI personal assistant. What would be the most important things it would do for you? How would it be better than current tools?
PARTICIPANT: It would be nice if it could help me improve prompts without me having to ask. For example, if I'm in situations where I get frustrated because I ask for something and it doesn't deliver, it could help me understand how I should ask for it, so I also learn how to ask for things in the future. That's something I feel they don't do today. Alone, if I ask, yes, maybe, but they never do.

The most important things it would do for me, maybe in daily life, I imagine like this: being able to solve things already knowing, without me having to explain every time what I want in repetitive tasks. For example, when translating something, that it already remembers that I speak Spanish and that I usually need translations into English. So, it already offers me those translations. I could tell it no, but not having to say every time I write something "I need you to translate this into English" in a simple and clear way, considering it's my second language. Not having to give so much explanation every time.

I think other things it could do for me are mostly organizational issues, like asking for help to do things. I remembered another case where I used artificial intelligence. I used ChatGPT to organize my trip to Europe with my boyfriend. I gave it the number of days we had available, that we were going to be traveling, what day we had the outbound flight, the return flight, which cities we wanted to visit, and we asked it to recommend how many days in each city it was worth staying or we needed to stay, and what things we could do each day. It worked quite well for me, but it's true that it was a bit unrealistic in terms of the time we had and the things to visit. For example, in one day it expected us to go to six places, but the reality is that, being there, between the fatigue accumulating and there being many things to see, maybe you want to see something and stay a while watching it and not just see it and go to the next attraction. It wasn't very realistic in that sense and it couldn't propose nice places to eat or stop either. Yes, it helped me organize places to go and visit by areas, but I feel it worked, although it needed a lot of my input too to understand, read it, understand if it was possible or not, and change things.

MODERATOR: You mentioned travel planning and that the AI was not very realistic. How would you like a perfect AI assistant to handle this type of planning?
PARTICIPANT: It would be ideal for the AI assistant to be realistic in the sense of suggesting things that can really be done. A clear example is that in one day it suggests doing ten different things, when a normal person in real life can simply visit three or four places, considering that they also need to rest, eat, etc. That was the main thing. I would also have liked that, when we asked for ticket prices or hotel suggestions, it sent options with availability for those dates, because the suggestions it had were not available for the dates we had already given. So I feel it would have been good if it acted a bit like a travel agent. I'm not asking it to book the tickets or pay for them for me, just to give concrete options that are available and that the itinerary makes sense.

MODERATOR: You mentioned that you would like the AI to help you with repetitive tasks and remember your preferences. What other forms of personalization would you like to see in an ideal AI assistant?
PARTICIPANT: These questions are difficult. I think I would just like to be able to save, maybe, like prompts or have a chat for this and not forget what that chat is for. For example, a chat for translations, but never forget that it always has to translate from Spanish to English. A chat where I put ingredients and it gives me recipes, and I don't have to remind it why I'm giving it ingredients and what I need it to return. I mean that with remembering preferences and with repetitive tasks, because they are things that repeat day to day in the routine. For example, needing translations or being able to search for information about an artist, or series suggestions. Those things happen to me that it remembers the initial request and that I don't have to remind it halfway through again.

*Q9*
MODERATOR: How would you like the AI to integrate with the systems you use (for example, calendar, email, etc.)? What would that allow you to do?
PARTICIPANT: Maybe regarding emails, it could be useful to summarize some if they are long or pre-filter things by grouping emails of the same type. Something like that occurs to me. In the calendar, for example, in the photos, I'm going to go to photos, which is also a product, it's not named there, but that's what I always use, the photo gallery. Or when you take a photo, that it adds information, not just a description of an image, but maybe it would be good that, for example, if I was traveling, it tells me where I was, so I don't forget what building I saw, since after a while you might forget. Also a bit of information about where that was would be good. In the calendar, maybe there are already alerts for upcoming events, but there could be ideas to prepare for an event. For example, if my event is a medical exam, that before going, a few hours before or a day before, that can be customizable, it reminds me and gives me tips to go prepared. For example, remember to bring the latest medical studies. I have many rehearsals because I sing, and I would like it to tell me: "Remember to vocalize" or schedule 15 minutes or half an hour in my calendar that day before the rehearsal event so that I vocalize and prepare the things I have to bring, review a song if I need to. Things like that would be good.

*Q10*
MODERATOR: Before we finish, I would like to know how you felt being interviewed by an AI...

*Q11*
MODERATOR: How did you feel about being interviewed by an AI instead of a person? What was different in this experience?
PARTICIPANT: I feel that the difference is that it can be good and bad at the same time. I'm not talking to a person on camera, I mean, I see myself, I'm recording myself, I have another monitor, but I see myself talking. I don't really know who is going to see this video, I don't know if someone is going to see this video talking about people or if it's simply a video that serves the artificial intelligence to understand what I'm telling it. I'm not very clear about it. There are also things I can't do, like asking questions. Oh, yes, the truth is that I haven't tried it. I can ask questions to the AI, I can ask why, what is the reason for this research or why are they asking me these questions. And what else, nothing. Not talking to a person can feel a bit cold, but at the same time I know that I'm talking alone in my house to the computer. I know that at some point they will understand or interpret it, but it makes me less nervous to escalate with someone. And another thing is that I can say it in my language, which is Spanish, and just talking to an interviewer who lives in the United States, their first language or their language is English, I would have to speak in English or simply in another language. Also, instead, I can choose in which language I feel more comfortable speaking, and that's much better. That's an advantage I see.

MODERATOR: You mentioned that you feel less nervous talking to an AI. Could you explain more about that difference in comfort compared to a traditional interview?
PARTICIPANT: Yes, I already explained it, and it's that I don't know if it makes me less nervous. What I say is that it worries me a little less because there is no one watching me and I feel less evaluated. In my personal case, I think it refers to that. But I miss a bit the warmth of talking to a person, being able to make a joke that they laugh, being able to see a little the face of the interviewer, which here I don't see. Those are the differences.
