*Q4*
MODERATOR: For what most common personal tasks do you use AI? Tell us about a few examples.

MODERATOR: You mentioned travel planning. How exactly do you use AI to gather information about places to visit?
PARTICIPANT: I plan what I can visit in a given country on a given day so that I don't have to travel from one end of the city to the other.

MODERATOR: How does AI help you optimize these sightseeing routes? What specific information do you get from it?
PARTICIPANT: It's best to move around a given city using the metro, public transport such as trams, buses, or trains. I wonder if I can visit two tourist attractions in one day.

*Q5*
MODERATOR: Tell us about a situation when you wanted to use AI but couldn't. What was the task? What prevented you from using AI?

*Q8*
MODERATOR: Imagine you have the ideal personal AI assistant. What are the most important things it should do for you? How would it be better than current tools?
PARTICIPANT: It would be best if it showed verified information, not fake, Linux.

MODERATOR: I understand you want to be sure about the reliability of the information. What other features would be important to you in an ideal AI assistant?
PARTICIPANT: That in the future it could help in everyday life but not replace face-to-face contact.

MODERATOR: How exactly do you imagine this help in everyday life? What tasks would it perform?
PARTICIPANT: I'm not sure if I need to see a specialist immediately for a specific illness or if I can wait for an appointment.

*Q9*
MODERATOR: How could such an AI assistant be connected to other systems you use (e.g., calendar, email, etc.)? What would this enable you to do?
PARTICIPANT: With the calendar, it could remind me of things I have noted there.

MODERATOR: Besides the calendar, what other systems would you like to connect the AI assistant to?
PARTICIPANT: Maybe with some home appliances.

MODERATOR: What specific home appliances would you like to connect with the AI assistant and what would it do with them?

*Q10*
MODERATOR: Before we finish, I would like to know your impressions of the conversation with AI...

*Q11*
MODERATOR: How did you feel answering questions from AI instead of a human? How was this experience different from talking to a person?
PARTICIPANT: AI still doesn't fully express itself correctly in a given language, so I preferred to contact a person from this side.

MODERATOR: Could you explain more precisely what makes you prefer to talk to a human? What specific language problems did you notice in the conversation with AI?
PARTICIPANT: Grammatical problems and face-to-face conversations cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence.

MODERATOR: You mentioned that face-to-face conversations are irreplaceable. What exactly do you miss in interaction with AI?
PARTICIPANT: In interaction with AI, if I talk face to face, I see how the person reacts to the questions asked, how they answer, what their facial expressions are.
