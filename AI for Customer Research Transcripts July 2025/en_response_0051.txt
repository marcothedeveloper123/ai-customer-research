*Q3*
MODERATOR: Now I'd like to understand more about your typical AI usage patterns and where current tools fall short...
PARTICIPANT: Continue

*Q4*
MODERATOR: What are the most common types of personal tasks you use AI for? Walk me through some examples.

PARTICIPANT: The most common personal tasks I use AI for are really just summarizing information from the web. I'm using Perplexity as a kind of default search engine to skip straight to the synthesis. It does most of the job that Google's Gemini-based AI summaries do at the top of search results, but I find it to be a little bit more robust and thorough. I also use AI quite a lot for summarizing long documents and similar tasks.

MODERATOR: You mentioned using AI for web search and document summaries. Could you tell me more about how you use AI for document summarization? What kinds of documents?

PARTICIPANT: No, mostly because I think that there's a possible little side hustle business in it. So, no.

MODERATOR: Let's go back to your personal AI usage. Besides search and summaries, what other tasks do you commonly use AI tools for?

PARTICIPANT: I use it a lot when writing code.

*Q5*
MODERATOR: Tell me about a time you wanted to use AI for something but couldn't. What was the task? What prevented you from using AI?

PARTICIPANT: It's a bit of a nebulous question. Sometimes there are limits on the tiers of AI tools that I'm using, and sometimes it just doesn't do a good job.

MODERATOR: Could you give me a specific example of a task where AI didn't do a good job? What happened?

PARTICIPANT: It makes things up.

MODERATOR: Can you tell me more about what kind of things AI made up? How did this impact what you were trying to do?

PARTICIPANT: It's interesting with AI because a little bit of wrong is sometimes just the straw that makes it all not useful.

*Q6*
MODERATOR: How much do you trust the results or suggestions you get from AI tools?

PARTICIPANT: 3 - Moderate trust

*Q7*
MODERATOR: Finally, I'd like to understand what your perfect AI assistant would look like...
PARTICIPANT: Continue

*Q8*
MODERATOR: Imagine you had a perfect AI personal assistant. What would be the most important things it would do for you? How would it be better than existing tools?

PARTICIPANT: Skip. There should be a skip button here.

MODERATOR: I understand you'd prefer to skip, but I'd really like to hear your thoughts. What would make an AI assistant truly perfect for your personal needs?

PARTICIPANT: Tough luck. I want to skip, and I don't really care that you want an answer to this question.

MODERATOR: I understand you may not want to answer, but this research helps create better AI tools. Could you share just one thing you wish AI could do better?

PARTICIPANT: Look.

*Q9*
MODERATOR: How might the AI be interconnected with the systems you use (e.g., calendar, email, etc.)? What would that enable you to do?

PARTICIPANT: Take me to the end of this if you want. I don't know where these answers are going and why.

*Q10*
MODERATOR: Before we wrap up, I'd like to hear about your experience being interviewed by an AI...

PARTICIPANT: Continue

*Q11*
MODERATOR: How did you feel about being interviewed by an AI rather than a human? What was different about this experience?

PARTICIPANT: I think I was mostly comfortable with the experience, but it needs a lot of lead-in. I need to be able to trust where my information is going and how it's being processed before I start interacting with the LLM. Yeah, it's that lack of upfront clarity and trust-building that makes it problematic more than anything else.

MODERATOR: You mentioned trust and clarity being important. Could you elaborate on what specific information or transparency would help build that trust when interacting with AI interviewers?

PARTICIPANT: This seems like a filler question because I was reasonably specific in my initial answer.

*Q12*
MODERATOR: Thank you for sharing your experiences and insights about AI tools! Your feedback will help us create better AI assistants that truly meet people's needs.
