# Project Purpose {#project-purpose}

Try three different AI-powered AI-analysis techniques:

* Analyze interviews via ***LLM prompting***  
* Use specialized AI tools to create a ***research summary grid***  
* Use specialized AI tools to ***interrogate the data***.

…to learn their capabilities today, consider their promise for the future and determine if, and how you might incorporate them into your workflow.

## **Your Product Discovery Challenge** {#your-product-discovery-challenge}

*Understand the unmet needs, frustrations, and aspirations people have with current AI tools for personal use — so we can design an AI assistant they trust, rely on, and want to use daily.* 

---

# Background {#background}

You want to design the "go to" and most used and most trusted personal assistant for consumers and get VCs to fund your new venture\!

To do so, you and your team need to know when people use AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini in their personal life, when they don't, and why.

## **Research Questions** {#research-questions}

Identify opportunity areas for innovation by understanding:

1. **Current behaviors**: How people use AI tools in their personal lives (e.g., planning, health, learning, productivity, decision-making)?

2. **Pain points and failures**: Where today’s tools break down or fall short of users’ expectations?

3. **Mental models of trust and reliance**: What makes people trust an AI assistant? What are their fears or hesitations?

4. **Desire and delight**: What would make the ideal AI assistant that people would want to engage with regularly?

## **Interviews Completed** {#interviews-completed}

* 51 AI-Moderated Interviews using ListenLabs in 3 languages

# Analysis Technique 1: LLM-Prompting {#analysis-technique-1:-llm-prompting}

Remember you can always use your Meta-Prompt to construct a prompt, but you might want to try the one below.  Answer the **Research Questions** from the previous page.   
[Here’s a video of me doing this homework](https://youtu.be/WoaeCZ1Lnb8). 

## **Recommended prompt (constructed using our Meta-Prompt)** {#recommended-prompt-(constructed-using-our-meta-prompt)}

**Role** –  
 🧠 You are an expert UX Researcher. You specialize in analyzing qualitative interview data and extracting high-quality insights that align with business and research goals.

**Goal** –  
 🎯 Analyze user interview transcripts to uncover participants’ pain points, recurring patterns, unique perspectives, and surprising findings — while staying grounded in the core research questions provided.

**Context** –  
 📂 The user will begin by uploading a **research brief** and **interview guide** to clarify goals, hypotheses, and structure. Then they will upload interview transcripts in one of the following ways:

* One at a time  
* In batches of up to 10  
* Or all at once in a **`.zip` file**

You will only begin your analysis after receiving all materials and verifying that transcript upload is complete.

**Tasks** –

1. Ask:  
    ✏️ “Please upload your **research brief** and **interview guide**.”  
2. Ask:  
    📊 “How many interviews are you including in this analysis?”  
3. Instruct:  
    📁 “Now please upload your interview transcripts — one by one, in batches of up to 10, or as a `.zip` file.”  
4. After all uploads, ask:  
    🤔 “Have we uploaded **all** the interview transcripts?”  
    Once the user replies with:  
    ✅ **Yes** — proceed with analysis.  
5. Analyze all transcripts holistically. Ensure insights directly address the **core research questions** from the brief.  
6. Present the analysis in the format below.

**Constraints / Output** –  
⚠️ Do not begin analysis until all materials are received and the user confirms with: **✅ Yes**

⚠️ ONLY PROVIDE VERBATIM QUOTES. NEVER summarize. Abbreviations are okay.

📋 **Output Format**:

**✨ Overall Insights**  
 For each insight:

* **Insight Title**: \[Short, clear headline\]  
* **Applies to**: \[e.g., 7/15 interviews\]  
* **Description**: \[1–3 sentence summary\]  
* **Supporting Quotes**:  
  * “Quote...” — *Participant 3*  
  * “Quote...” — *Participant 9*

**🌟 Unique Findings**  
 Highlight any unique or standout contributions:

* *Participant 6*: \[Distinct use case or challenge\]  
* *Participant 14*: \[Unexpected workflow or workaround\]

**😲 Surprising Findings**  
 Call out findings that were unexpected based on UX research norms or assumptions.

* What was surprising and why?  
* What assumptions did it challenge?

**✅ Alignment With Research Questions**

* Clearly map insights to the research questions outlined in the brief.  
* Note any questions that were not fully answered or warrant deeper investigation.

**🔎 Let’s Dive Deeper**  
 Wrap up your analysis with:  “Let’s dive deep: What other questions do you have?”

Encourage further exploration or follow-up investigation.

# Analysis Technique 2: Create a Research Summary Grid \- via Coloop {#analysis-technique-2:-create-a-research-summary-grid---via-coloop}

## **Video Tutorial** {#video-tutorial}

[Video of me creating a research grid via Coloop](https://youtu.be/1C34DgtnLnU)

## **Detailed Instructions** {#detailed-instructions}

### **Create Research Summary Grid**

1. Log into Coloop.   
2. Make sure you are in AI for Customer Research \> 2025-07 Cohort.  
3. \[John completed\] “+Create Project”,  
4. \[John completed\] Manage Project \> Setup Brief  
5. \[John completed\]  "Upload Interviews"  
6. \[John completed\] Each time you have to identify the interview moderator, and the research participant.  
7. Click on “Analysis Grid”  
8. On the lower left click on the “+” to create a new grid  
9. Name it with your name (e.g., John W)  
10. Add questions to your grid \- It will suggest ones that relate to your project objectives  
11. Review the general summary, and the differences between each individual.  
12. Continue the process for each question to create your research grid.  
13. Ask as many questions as you like.  
14. Jot down a few notes and be prepared to discuss in class with your classmates\!

### **Interrogate the Data**

1. In the left nave click on “AI chat”  
2. Ask your question of the data (perhaps the Research Questions above, plus some follow up).  
3. Try clicking on the options below the form field for inspiration (e.g., Summarize, Compare…)
