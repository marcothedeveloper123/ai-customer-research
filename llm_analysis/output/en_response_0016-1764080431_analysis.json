  "pain_points": [
    "Cannot fully trust AI output – only 80‑90% confidence, must verify details",
    "AI‑generated code often fails on first try, requiring manual debugging",
    "More complex tasks demand extra time to clean up AI‑produced results",
    "AI sometimes provides information that is not completely accurate or authentic"

  "trust_factors": [
    "Accuracy and reliability of the answer",
    "Consistency of output across repeated queries",
    "Ability to verify information easily",
    "Natural, non‑robotic tone that feels human‑like"

  "desires": [
    "A single daily briefing that shows schedule, weather, clothing suggestions, and reminders",
    "Full integration with calendar and email so the assistant can plan the day and week automatically",
    "Concise, visually appealing formatting that requires no further editing",
    "An assistant that sounds natural rather than robotic",

  "unique_insights": "The participant perceives a paradox: AI interviews feel less judgmental, encouraging more openness, yet the one‑sided information flow makes them more guarded. They also stress that an ideal assistant must blend high accuracy with a natural, non‑robotic voice, and act as a single hub that pulls in calendar and email data to eliminate the need to switch between multiple apps."
