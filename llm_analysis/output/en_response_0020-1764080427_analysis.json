    }
  ],
  "unique_insights": "The participant explicitly grants AI more leeway than a human interviewer, tolerating repetitive or \"parroting\" questions because they view the AI as still immature. They see AI primarily as a high‑volume filter that can surface consensus‑based reliable information, yet they struggle with AI’s inability to retain personal preference history (e.g., recipe sources). Their frustration is not about AI failing outright but about the extra effort required to refine prompts, especially when they already know how to accomplish the task. The desire for reflective, back‑and‑forth dialogue to overcome procrastination‑related blocks is a novel use case that goes beyond simple task automation."
