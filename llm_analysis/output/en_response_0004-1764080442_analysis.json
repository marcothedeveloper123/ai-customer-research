  "key_behaviors": [
    "Uses multiple AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity) multiple times per day",
    "Leverages AI for copy‑editing emails and personal writing",
    "Creates study guides, flashcards, and asks AI to act as a coach or teacher",
    "Uses AI for research tasks and quick information gathering",
    "Attempts to use AI for complex work‑related tasks (e.g., competitive analysis) but abandons when it fails",
    "Envisions AI helping with transcription, drafting surveys, and research methodology"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "AI cannot perform in‑depth competitive analysis from a user‑research perspective",
    "Difficulty crafting prompts that yield useful results leads to frustration",
    "Frequent failure on complex tasks causes the participant to stop using AI for those tasks",
    "Lack of trust in AI connecting to personal systems (calendar, email, etc.)",
    "Overall moderate trust (rating 3) indicates uncertainty about AI reliability"
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Moderate trust overall (rating 3)",
    "Trust in AI for surface‑level copy editing and generating concise text",
    "Distrust of AI handling personal data or system integrations without explicit control"
  ],
  "desires": [
    "An AI that acts as a constant teacher or intern for work tasks",
    "AI assistance that speeds up copy editing, transcription, and first‑draft creation of surveys and research methods",
    "Tighter integration with work tools **only if** the user retains full control",
    "AI that can conduct rapid user‑testing interviews, reducing preparation time and moderator fatigue",
    "A reliable AI partner for complex analytical work that currently fails (e.g., competitive analysis)"

  ],
  "unique_insights": "The participant, a UX strategist, sees AI not just as a personal productivity tool but as a potential \"constant teacher/intern\" that could dramatically accelerate research workflows—especially rapid prototype testing and interview moderation—yet remains wary of granting AI deep integration with personal systems. This blend of high expectations for work‑focused assistance and strong control preferences is a nuanced stance that highlights the need for granular permission models and transparent, task‑specific competence guarantees."
