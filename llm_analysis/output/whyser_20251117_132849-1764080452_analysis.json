  "unique_insights": "The participant treats AI primarily as an occasional novelty tool for creative fun, yet envisions a concrete professional role for it—acting as a silent editor and process‑flow verifier for high‑stakes emails. Their trust hinges on AI providing a reliable, neutral second opinion, especially to replace a human reviewer when none is available. They also reveal a strong preference for voice communication to resolve conflicts, highlighting an opportunity for AI to bridge the gap between real‑time conversation and written documentation."
