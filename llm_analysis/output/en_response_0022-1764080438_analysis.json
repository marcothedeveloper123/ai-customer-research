  "unique_insights": "The participant, a professional user researcher, reports no major failures with ChatGPT yet expresses a strong desire for a conversational, guided prompting experience that reduces the cognitive load of figuring out prompts and navigating a cluttered UI. They value speed and quality in writing and summarization, trust the tool highly, but remain skeptical about AI’s ability to grasp emotional nuance, highlighting a clear boundary between functional assistance and human‑level empathy."
