  "unique_insights": "The participant frames AI as a \"personal IT consultant\" that could offload mundane logistics (email triage, selling/unneeded items, recycling, disaster prep, financial aggregation) to free up \"brain space and positive energy\" for creative work. Unlike many users who seek conversational rapport, this participant explicitly prefers a survey‑style, low‑anthropomorphized interaction and wants the ability to toggle interaction modes based on audience. Security concerns are not just about data leakage but about AI taking unintended actions to achieve a goal, which heavily limits willingness to grant broader permissions."
