    "Provides feedback to ChatGPT when its suggestions diverge from intended direction"

  "pain_points": [
    "Long email drafts require manual condensation; wants quicker summarisation",
    "When AI suggestions stray from the intended idea, extra mental effort is needed to evaluate and correct them",

    "Uncertainty about how AI could connect to other productivity apps"

  "trust_factors": [
    "Moderate trust (rated 3) in AI outputs",
    "Trust increases when AI improves grammar, conciseness, and generates useful ideas",

  "desires": [
    "AI that builds directly on the user’s prompt without deviating from the original intent",

  "unique_insights": "The participant reports no major functional failures despite heavy daily use, which is uncommon among users who typically encounter limitations. Their trust is moderate and hinges on the AI staying tightly aligned with their own ideas; they view AI divergence as a cognitive cost rather than a creative benefit. Additionally, the participant finds a text‑only AI interview experience surprisingly seamless because there is no visual avatar, highlighting that perceived 'human‑likeness' may not be necessary for comfort."
