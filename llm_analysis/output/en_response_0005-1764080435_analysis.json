    "Uses ChatGPT and Google Gemini about once a month for personal tasks",
    "Leverages AI to plan weekly meals",
    "Uses AI to design multi‑day travel itineraries (routes, points of interest, activities)",
    "Relies on AI to generate lists of hotels or locations while planning trips",
    "Double‑checks AI‑generated information because of frequent inaccuracies",
    "Wishes AI would sync with personal calendar and email for reminders and scheduling"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "AI often provides incorrect or non‑existent locations (e.g., hotels in the wrong state)",
    "Inaccurate information occurs frequently – participant estimates about half the time",
    "Need to manually verify every suggestion, which adds friction",
    "Low overall trust in AI outputs (rated 2 / 5)",
    "Current tools do not integrate with personal productivity systems (calendar, email)",
    "AI lacks ability to support executive‑function challenges such as organization and structure"
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Accuracy of information is the primary driver of trust",
    "Consistency across queries (repeating the same mistake reduces trust)",
    "Ability to integrate with existing tools and provide reliable reminders would increase reliance"
  ],
  "desires": [
    "An AI assistant that can plan an entire week, including meals, travel, and daily tasks",
    "Accurate, up‑to‑date information without the need for double‑checking",
    "Seamless integration with calendar and email to set reminders, schedule travel time, and draft responses",
    "Support for executive‑function difficulties by providing structure, organization, and proactive prompts",
    "A more personable, less formal interaction style (though not a core functional need)"

    }
  ],
  "unique_insights": "The participant explicitly links AI assistance to their personal executive‑function challenges, describing AI as a potential source of external structure and organization they lack. This connection between cognitive support and AI utility is a nuanced need that goes beyond typical productivity or information‑retrieval use cases. Additionally, the participant rates overall trust very low (2/5) and reports that inaccuracies occur roughly half the time, highlighting a critical threshold where the friction of double‑checking outweighs the time‑saving benefits."
