  "key_behaviors": [
    "Uses AI tools (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Google Gemini) daily for personal tasks",
    "Relies on AI to revise grammar and meaning of personal communications",
    "Uses AI for information retrieval and analysis (e.g., extracting customer quotes)",
    "Attempts to compare specific product models (e‑bike) using AI",
    "Prefers AI that can integrate multiple sources and provide critical feedback"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "AI sometimes returns factually incorrect information (e‑bike comparison)",
    "Accuracy issues occur about once a month, reducing confidence",
    "Current AI does not ask clarifying questions or provide critical input during a task",
    "Lack of non‑verbal or interactive feedback makes interview responses feel constrained",
    "Difficulty capturing broader cross‑references and connections in AI‑driven interactions"
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Moderate overall trust (rated 3 out of 5)",
    "Desire for AI to challenge its own responses to build trust",
    "Need for AI to request critical input or clarification during a workflow",
    "Importance of maintaining personal control over decisions"
  ],
  "desires": [
    "An AI that pulls from multiple sources and can self‑challenge its answers",
    "Ability for the AI to pause and ask the user for critical input throughout a task",
    "Secure integration with internal corporate communication infrastructure while accessing external data",
    "Feedback mechanisms (including non‑verbal cues) that confirm the AI captured broader references"

      "quote": "Great question. I feel like references across questions or the things that come to my mind about the broader topic don't have that much space, and I'm not sure if this is captured.",
      "topic": "Limitation of AI interview format"
    },
    {
      "quote": "I think it would be great to have some feedback when I, for instance, cross‑reference broader topics in order to be sure that this is somehow captured. Maybe some nonverbal feedback, as we have when we talk with other people, would be helpful to convey that kind of more interactive communication.",
      "topic": "Desire for feedback/non‑verbal cues"
    },
    {
      "quote": "Yeah, I think it does affect the quality of my responses because I don't go any deeper.",
      "topic": "Impact of constrained interaction on response depth"
    }
  ],
  "unique_insights": "The participant envisions an AI that not only aggregates multiple sources but also actively challenges its own answers and pauses to solicit critical user input, seeing this self‑questioning as a key trust builder. Additionally, they stress the need for a secure, corporate‑linked assistant that can safely bridge internal systems with external data—a nuance not commonly highlighted in personal‑use contexts. Finally, the desire for non‑verbal, interactive feedback during AI‑mediated conversations reveals a deeper expectation for conversational richness beyond text alone."
