  "key_behaviors": [
    "Uses ChatGPT weekly for personal tasks",
    "Inputs medical exam results into ChatGPT to interpret health condition",
    "Uses ChatGPT to edit long personal letters for typos and style",
    "Copies exercise names from ChatGPT and searches Google for pictures",
    "Envisions an AI that could research and book professional training workshops"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "ChatGPT cannot generate or display exercise pictures, requiring a second tool (Google)",
    "Limited trust in AI outputs (moderate trust, needs verification)",
    "Uncertainty about how AI would integrate with calendar, email, and other personal systems",
    "No examples of tasks where AI fails, suggesting limited awareness of AI’s boundaries"
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Moderate trust level (3 out of 5)",
    "Wants AI to be as efficient and effective as the user themselves",
    "Needs AI to consistently understand needs and deliver accurate results before delegating tasks",
    "Perceives human interviewers as more empathetic, which influences trust"
  ],
  "desires": [
    "AI that can locate, evaluate, and book relevant training workshops automatically",
    "Seamless integration with calendar, email, and other personal productivity tools",
    "Ability to provide visual content (e.g., exercise images) within the same conversation",
    "Higher reliability that would raise trust to a level‑5, allowing the user to rely on AI without double‑checking"

      "quote": "When I use it for health information, I wanted to see the exercises that were suggested for my health condition, and ChatGPT didn't generate the pictures. So, I had to copy and paste the names of the exercises and then ask Google to find the pictures.",

  "unique_insights": "The participant leverages AI to become a more proactive patient, using it to ask deeper questions during a medical appointment—a clear example of AI enhancing personal agency in health decisions. Additionally, they view AI as a \"survey-like\" tool lacking empathy, which directly impacts their willingness to trust and rely on it for more complex, personal tasks."
