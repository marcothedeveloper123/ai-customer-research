  "key_behaviors": [
    "Uses Claude almost every day for baby‑related questions, recipe creation, and translation tasks",
    "Relies on Claude‑built app (by husband) to track running data",
    "Employs AI tools (Clotter, TrackGPT) for quick information look‑ups and synthesis",
    "Double‑checks AI‑generated outputs before using them in personal or professional deliverables",
    "Prefers to invoke AI only when needed, keeping it out of the primary workflow UI"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "AI interfaces can clutter the UI and get in the way of primary tasks",
    "Lack of visible prompts/questions makes the interaction feel static and “talking to the void”",
    "Interview with an AI felt “annoying” because it was long, not dynamic, and didn’t show the questions",
    "No summarization or echo‑back of user input, leading to uncertainty whether the AI is listening"
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Higher trust when AI provides suggestions but the user makes the final decision",
    "Lower trust when AI acts on the user’s behalf without explicit control",
    "Need for the AI to be transparent (show questions, summarize input) to demonstrate it is listening",
    "Reliance on personal verification (e.g., double‑checking translations) to protect reputation"
  ],
  "desires": [
    "A streamlined, on‑demand AI that does not intrude on existing UI",
    "Ability to summon AI only for specific tasks without it “getting in the way”",
    "Real‑time summarization or echo of user statements so the user can confirm accuracy",
    "Clear visual display of the AI’s questions/prompts during a conversation"
  ],

  "unique_insights": "The participant treats AI as an extensible tool that must stay under their direct control, even for low‑stakes tasks like recipe translation. They explicitly link UI clutter to reduced willingness to engage, and they request real‑time visual feedback (displayed questions and summarization) as a core trust mechanism—suggesting that perceived attentiveness, not just output quality, drives trust."
