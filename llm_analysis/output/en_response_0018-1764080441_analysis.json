  "unique_insights": "The participant exhibits a paradoxical relationship with AI: despite a low trust rating (2/5) and limited confidence in AI's capabilities, they still use AI weekly for routine planning and explicitly desire an AI that eliminates the need for manual scheduling. Their primary frustration is not technical (e.g., poor accuracy) but experiential—missing human warmth in AI interactions, which they feel reduces the richness of their responses and overall engagement."
