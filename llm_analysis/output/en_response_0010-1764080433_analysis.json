  "unique_insights": "The participant reports high overall trust in AI (rating 4/5) yet simultaneously worries about a \"trust trap\" where over‑reliance could be unjustified. Their primary friction point is not the lack of functionality but the inability of AI to guarantee source credibility and preserve personal voice, leading them to manually cherry‑pick and edit AI output. They are also ambivalent about deep integration with personal productivity tools, preferring optional, controlled connections only if clear benefits are demonstrated."
