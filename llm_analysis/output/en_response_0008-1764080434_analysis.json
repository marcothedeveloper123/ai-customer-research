    "Repetition in AI‑driven interview format feels unnatural",
    "Lack of visual or conversational richness in AI interview (text‑only)"

    "Perceived professionalism of AI‑generated text",
    "AI’s ability to infer intent from draft context",

  "unique_insights": "The participant exhibits a paradoxical relationship with AI: extremely high daily usage for diverse tasks yet rates trust as very low, especially for factual domains like code research. They treat AI as a creative catalyst that can infer intent from drafts, but they also demand rigorous verification, indicating a need for hybrid workflows where AI augments but does not replace expert judgment. Their ideal assistant blends deep project‑management intelligence (milestone sequencing, multi‑project prioritization, budget alerts) with seamless integration into existing tools, a combination rarely articulated by users focused solely on text generation."
