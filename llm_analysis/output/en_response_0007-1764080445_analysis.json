  "unique_insights": "The participant exhibits a strong, principled aversion to AI, emphasizing that any AI system must respect an explicit \"no\" and that current AI fails to pick up basic social cues. This highlights a need for robust opt‑out mechanisms and better detection of user refusal, beyond just addressing privacy or trust concerns."
