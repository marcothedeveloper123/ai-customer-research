      "quote": "I could also think of it benefiting from grocery shopping. I do a lot of online grocery shopping, so having my regular cart being ordered, maybe just asking me if I'm ready to reorder and confirming with me what's in there before it goes and does the regular shopping.",

    {
      "quote": "Yeah, definitely the reading of text, but also, you know, when there is an in‑person element to interviewing, you can have a different vibe with a person. There's just something different about being able to connect with people personally and have that experience, I think.",

    {
      "quote": "I think it could really depend on the subject matter. For instance, if the interview subject is on something really sensitive, like a reorganization or any other delicate issue, you would want to take the time to show people that you are listening to them with a human touch rather than with AI.",

    }
  ],
  "unique_insights": "The participant reports no personal‑use limitations yet, using AI mainly for low‑stakes shopping decisions and accepting occasional hallucinations as normal. Their trust remains moderate because they set clear expectations and guardrails. The most compelling desire is for a truly proactive assistant that anticipates routine tasks (appointments, grocery orders) without prompting, highlighting a gap between current reactive AI tools and the user’s need for autonomous, schedule‑integrated assistance."
