  "participant_id": "en_response_0021.txt",
  "key_behaviors": [
    "Uses AI tools (Google Gemini, ChatGPT) on a weekly basis for personal tasks",
    "Uploads class objectives or PowerPoint slides to generate practice exam questions",
    "Uses AI as an editor for grammar and style improvements in papers",
    "Prefers web‑based AI over installed software (e.g., Grammarly) because it runs cooler on the laptop",
    "Employs AI for brainstorming ideas despite occasional hallucinations",
    "Cross‑checks AI‑generated content against personal notes to verify accuracy",
    "Envisions AI assisting with meal planning, grocery shopping, budgeting, and calendar/email management"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "AI sometimes provides false or fabricated information (hallucinations) that is hard to detect",
    "Time wasted verifying inaccurate AI output, especially when searching for non‑existent studies",
    "Grammarly overheats the computer, making the web AI feel more convenient",
    "Lack of seamless integration with personal systems (calendar, email) limits usefulness",
    "AI appears to recognize buzzwords without true understanding, leading to shallow conversations"
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Moderate overall trust (rated 3/5)",
    "Higher trust when AI output can be validated against personal notes or known sources",
    "Trust increased by convenience and performance (web AI runs smoother than installed tools)",
    "Trust decreased by hallucinations and inability to verify information automatically"
  ],
  "desires": [
    "AI that can generate meal‑prep ideas using the same set of ingredients to save time and money",
    "Budgeting assistance that incorporates local cost data and personal financial experience",
    "Deep integration with calendar and email to auto‑populate events, summarize messages, and organize spam",
    "A more human‑like conversational ability: asking clarifying questions, providing contextual anecdotes, and showing genuine understanding",
    "Reliable fact‑checking or source citation to reduce hallucinations"

  "unique_insights": "The participant leverages AI not only as a study aid but as a surrogate exam‑writer, uploading course materials to generate board‑style questions that mimic professor phrasing—a use case that blends content creation with personalized learning. They switched from a dedicated editing app to a web AI primarily for performance reasons (overheating), highlighting hardware constraints as a driver of tool adoption. Their ideal assistant spans academic, culinary, and financial domains and explicitly calls for tight integration with personal data streams (calendar, email) while also demanding human‑like conversational depth and reliable fact‑checking, revealing a desire for a unified life‑manager rather than a set of siloed utilities."
