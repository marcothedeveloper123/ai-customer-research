  "unique_insights": "The participant frames the ideal AI assistant as a \"second brain\" that offloads routine, detail‑heavy tasks (like consolidating calendar events from paper, texts, and email) rather than as a decision‑making authority. Trust is not just about accuracy; it is also shaped by broader media narratives and the participant's mental model of LLMs as statistical generators. Even though the participant is skeptical of AI for high‑stakes work, they see clear value for AI‑mediated surveys and diary studies, suggesting a nuanced split between contexts where AI is acceptable (low‑effort data collection) versus where human interaction is preferred (nuanced probing, conversational flow)."
