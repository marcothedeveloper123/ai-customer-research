  "key_behaviors": [
    "Uses AI tools weekly for personal tasks",
    "Relies on ChatGPT for reviewing and correcting APA citations",
    "Uses AI to customize resumes and cover letters for job applications",
    "Attempts to generate UI mockups and visual assets with AI",
    "Experiments with AI for complex transcript and mapping analysis",
    "Uses AI for work‑related reports, visuals, and slide decks"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "AI-generated UI mockups are low quality and hard to edit",
    "AI fails to correctly analyze multi‑hour transcripts and visual mappings, causing wasted time",
    "AI requires very detailed prompts for complex tasks and does not understand context automatically",
    "Lack of integration with existing tools (recruiting platforms, calendars, etc.) limits usefulness",
    "Inconsistent performance leads to hesitation to reuse AI for similar complex tasks"
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Moderate trust overall (rated 3/5)",
    "Trust increases when AI can explain citation errors and provide correct formatting",
    "Trust decreases when AI produces inaccurate analysis or unusable visual designs",
    "Reliance on AI is higher for low‑stakes, simpler personal tasks"
  ],
  "desires": [
    "An assistant that automatically connects to all relevant documentation and tools",
    "Context‑aware understanding of research projects without needing elaborate prompts",
    "Conversational learning that remembers prior interactions and simplifies future prompts",
    "Ability to choose level of detail (high‑level vs. detailed) based on task risk",
    "Automatic detection of inconsistencies across integrated tools (e.g., recruiting platforms, calendars)",
    "Seamless generation and editable UI mockups that match design intent"

    {
      "quote": "I generate a first draft of the APA citation or reference and then feed that into tools. Generally, ChatGPT is usually my go-to. I have it review the citations and references to ensure they're accurate, and it provides examples of where it's wrong, explains why it's wrong, and shows what the correct formatting should be for APA so that I can fix it.",

    {
      "quote": "I was trying to use AI to help me create some visuals, like UI mockups... AI didn't really create great images or great UIs, especially static UIs. I think it really struggled with coming up with elements that are actually representative of what I'm trying to envision, and it has a challenge with editing parts of the UI that are incorrect and that I want to fix.",

    {
      "quote": "We were trying to create a project to analyze a bunch of different transcripts... AI ... wasn't really analyzing the mappings or didn't know how to interpret the mappings... we ended up having to scrap that plan... set us back by a couple of hours or maybe even a couple of days.",

      "quote": "The perfect AI personal assistant would be able to connect with all the documentation and tools that I need, understand the full context of my research study or whatever I'm working on, and grasp what I need and what I'm looking for without me having to write out a complex AI prompt.",

      "quote": "The conversational learning would be really valuable, especially when I'm writing out a prompt and it could detect, \"Hey, you don't need to give me that set of instructions. I remember that from last time.\"",

  ],
  "unique_insights": "The participant, a UX researcher pursuing an AI master’s, uniquely blends academic and professional AI use, highlighting a desire for an assistant that not only automates routine formatting tasks but also acts as a contextual bridge across multiple specialized research tools. Their emphasis on conversational learning that remembers prior prompts and adjusts prompting complexity is a nuanced expectation not commonly voiced, indicating a need for AI that evolves from a static query tool into a proactive, integrated research partner."
