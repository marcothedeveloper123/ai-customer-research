## 1. OVERALL INSIGHTS  

| # | Insight (title) | # of interviews* | Description (what we learned) | Representative quotes (behaviour / pain‑point / trust / desire) |
|---|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **AI is a “writing & summarising” workhorse** | **15 / 22** | Participants use LLMs most often for anything that involves text – drafting emails, polishing prose, creating outlines, summarising long articles or research PDFs, and generating quick bullet‑point lists. The value is speed and the feeling that the AI “gets the grammar right”. | • “Uses AI to improve writing (grammar, cohesiveness) for case studies.”  <br>• “Relies on AI to make text sound more professional and succinct.”  <br>• “Uses AI to create executive summaries of longer documents.” |
| 2 | **Trust is conditional – hallucinations = friction** | **14 / 22** | Trust is moderate (average rating ≈ 3/5) and hinges on factual accuracy. Hallucinations, missing citations, or wrong code force users to double‑check, which erodes confidence and limits delegation to low‑stakes tasks. | • Pain: “Occasional hallucinations or ‘wrong path’ answers that require extra prompting.”  <br>• Trust factor: “Higher trust when AI provides links to reputable review sites.”  <br>• Desire: “Reliable fact‑checking or source citation to reduce hallucinations.” |
| 3 | **Strong desire for proactive, calendar‑centric integration** | **12 / 22** | Users repeatedly ask for an assistant that *knows* their schedule, can auto‑populate events, suggest optimal times, and even generate a full weekly plan (work + leisure). The current manual copy‑paste workflow is a major pain point. | • Behavior: “Wishes AI could automatically generate a full weekly schedule that includes work and leisure.”  <br>• Pain: “Lack of proactive, automated integration with calendar and shopping apps.”  <br>• Desire: “An AI assistant that automatically schedules appointments and makes phone calls without prompting.” |
| 4 | **Privacy & control are non‑negotiable gate‑keepers** | **10 / 22** | Even enthusiastic users balk at granting deep access (email, calendar, financial data). Perceived intrusiveness and fear of data misuse outweigh the convenience of tighter integration. | • Pain: “Reluctance to grant email access due to privacy concerns, limiting integration.”  <br>• Trust factor: “Fear that AI will misuse personal data.”  <br>• Desire: “Non‑intrusive integration that respects privacy.” |
| 5 | **AI as a reflective partner for mental‑block resolution** | **8 / 22** | A subset of participants treat the assistant as a “thinking partner” that asks back‑and‑forth questions, surfaces hidden assumptions, and helps break large tasks into manageable steps. This use case is distinct from pure information retrieval. | • Behavior: “Values AI as a reflective partner that can ask back‑and‑forth questions to overcome mental blocks.”  <br>• Desire: “Reflective dialogue that helps identify and overcome mental blocks.”  <br>• Trust factor: “Desire for AI to challenge its own responses to build trust.” |
| 6 | **Fragmented tool ecosystems cause cognitive overload** | **9 / 22** | Users juggle 4‑10 different AI products (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Copilot, etc.) plus niche add‑ons (Zotero, Notion, Otter). Switching costs, inconsistent UI, and lack of a unified “brain” lead to fatigue and abandonment of more complex tasks. | • Pain: “Difficulty orchestrating many tools together; integration feels intimidating.”  <br>• Behavior: “Builds a personal ‘writing stack’ that combines note‑taking, bibliography, and LLM tools.”  <br>• Desire: “A single daily briefing that shows schedule, weather, clothing suggestions, and reminders.” |
| 7 | **Low‑stakes tasks are safe zones; high‑stakes tasks remain human‑only** | **13 / 22** | Participants are comfortable delegating routine, low‑risk activities (grocery lists, simple email drafts) but revert to manual methods for health decisions, financial planning, or anything requiring legal/clinical accuracy. | • Behavior: “Uses AI for recipe ideas but often falls back to trusted websites.”  <br>• Pain: “AI cannot access personal financial data needed to generate a budget.”  <br>• Trust factor: “Higher trust when AI operates in a constrained, well‑defined context.” |

## 2. PATTERNS & THEMES  

| Theme | Core idea | Representative items (grouped) |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Text‑centric productivity** | Writing, editing, summarising, list‑making dominate usage. | “Uses AI to improve writing…”, “Creates grocery lists and bi‑weekly task schedules with AI”, “Uses AI for copy‑editing emails”. |
| **Verification loop** | Users treat AI output as a *first draft* that must be cross‑checked. | “Cross‑checks AI‑generated content against personal notes”, “No reliable way to verify AI‑generated answers”, “Hallucinations… require extra prompting”. |
| **Proactive automation desire** | Expectation that AI should *anticipate* needs (scheduling, re‑ordering). | “Wishes AI could automatically generate a full weekly schedule”, “Automatic grocery re‑ordering with a confirmation step”. |
| **Privacy‑first stance** | Reluctance to grant deep system access; demand for clear data‑use policies. | “Reluctance to grant email access”, “Strong need for privacy and data security”. |
| **Reflective dialogue** | Conversational back‑and‑forth to surface ideas, break mental blocks. | “Values AI as a reflective partner”, “Reflective dialogue that helps identify and overcome mental blocks”. |
| **Tool fragmentation** | Multiple overlapping AI products cause cognitive load. | “Uses multiple AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot…)”, “Difficulty orchestrating many tools together”. |
| **Task‑risk stratification** | Low‑risk vs. high‑risk task boundaries. | “Uses AI for recipe ideas but often falls back to trusted websites”, “AI cannot access personal financial data”. |
| **Interface fatigue** | Text‑only, repetitive interview UI is annoying; desire for richer modalities. | “Awkwardness of text‑only AI interview format”, “More human‑like interaction for sensitive conversations”. |

These themes cut across the four research questions and help explain why certain behaviours appear (e.g., heavy writing usage) while others remain aspirational (proactive scheduling).

## 3. ALIGNMENT WITH RESEARCH QUESTIONS  

### **RQ 1 – Current behaviors: How people use AI tools in their personal lives**  

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Writing‑centric daily use** – 70 % of participants run AI multiple times per day for drafting, editing, summarising. | “Uses AI multiple times per day”, “Rewrites emails, texts, and proposals with AI”. |
| **Planning & information aggregation** – Travel itineraries, meal planning, product comparisons, and quick fact look‑ups are common but often supplemented with manual verification. | “Uses AI for travel planning to aggregate and filter large amounts of information”, “Leverages AI to generate multiple list and chart formats”. |
| **Hybrid tool stacks** – Users combine 2‑5 AI services plus niche productivity apps (Notion, Zotero, Otter). | “Uses multiple AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity) multiple times per day”. |
| **Low‑frequency users** – 4 participants (≈ 18 %) report < monthly usage or explicit refusal. | “Does not use AI tools for personal tasks”, “Explicitly refuses any AI assistance”. |

### **RQ 2 – Pain points and failures: Where today’s tools break down**  

| Pain category | Frequency | Illustrative quotes |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Hallucinations / inaccurate output** | 14/22 | “Occasional hallucinations or ‘wrong path’ answers that require extra prompting”. |
| **Lack of proactive integration** | 12/22 | “Lack of proactive, automated integration with calendar and shopping apps”. |
| **Privacy & security concerns** | 10/22 | “Reluctance to grant email access due to privacy concerns”. |
| **Fragmented UI / tool overload** | 9/22 | “Difficulty orchestrating many tools together; integration feels intimidating”. |
| **Verification overhead** | 13/22 | “No reliable way to verify AI‑generated answers, leading to reduced reliance”. |
| **Limited real‑time data** | 8/22 | “ChatGPT does not provide real‑time data (weather, prices, news)”. |

### **RQ 3 – Mental models of trust and reliance: What makes people trust an AI assistant**  

| Trust driver | Evidence | Relative weight |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Source transparency / citations** | “Higher trust when AI provides links to reputable review sites”, “Presence of clear, verifiable source citations”. | High |
| **Consistency & repeatability** | “Consistency across queries (repeating the same mistake reduces trust)”. | Medium |
| **Guardrails & explicit limits** | “Trust maintained by using guardrails and knowing the limits of the technology”. | Medium |
| **Human‑in‑the‑loop safety net** | “Preference for a human‑in‑the‑loop or other vetting mechanism”. | Medium |
| **Privacy guarantees** | “Strong need for privacy and data security”, “Desire for clear liability guarantees”. | High (as a *gatekeeper*). |
| **Proactive helpfulness** (when accurate) | “Rates trust in AI outputs as high (4/5) when it speeds up writing and summarisation”. | Medium |

Overall, trust is **conditional**: users will rely on AI for low‑stakes, well‑scoped tasks *if* the system is transparent, consistent, and respects privacy.

### **RQ 4 – Desire and delight: What would make the ideal AI assistant**  

| Desired capability | Number of participants mentioning it | Key phrasing |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Proactive scheduling & reminders** | 12 | “An AI assistant that automatically schedules appointments and makes phone calls without prompting”. |
| **Seamless calendar & email integration (opt‑in)** | 11 | “Integration with calendar (optional email sync) for context‑aware suggestions”. |
| **Reliable fact‑checking & source citation** | 10 | “Higher factual reliability to reduce need for manual verification”. |
| **Reflective, conversational partner** | 8 | “Reflective dialogue that helps identify and overcome mental blocks”. |
| **Privacy‑first, controllable integration** | 9 | “Non‑intrusive integration that respects privacy”. |
| **Unified “second brain” hub** | 7 | “A single daily briefing that shows schedule, weather, clothing suggestions, and reminders”. |
| **Automation of repetitive chores (groceries, bills, errands)** | 6 | “Automatic grocery re‑ordering with a confirmation step”, “AI that can perform physical tasks – run errands, clean the house”. |

The *delight* factor emerges when **proactivity** is combined with **trust‑building mechanisms** (transparent sources, privacy controls) and a **human‑like conversational style** that feels supportive rather than robotic.

## 4. SYNTHESIS & DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS  

| Recommendation | Rationale (linked to insights) | Suggested implementation |
|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **1. “Smart Scheduler” module** – a calendar‑aware assistant that proposes, confirms, and creates events (opt‑in). | Insight 3 (proactive integration) + Trust driver: transparency (show source of suggested times). | Use OAuth‑based read‑only calendar access; present suggested slots with confidence scores; require explicit “yes” before creation. |
| **2. Built‑in citation & verification pane** – every factual claim is accompanied by a clickable source list and a “confidence” meter. | Insight 2 (hallucinations) + Trust driver: source transparency. | Auto‑fetch URLs from web‑search APIs; highlight statements with low confidence for user review. |
| **3. Privacy‑first permission model** – granular toggles (calendar, email, finances) with clear data‑use statements and local‑only processing where possible. | Insight 4 (privacy gate‑keeper). | Adopt a “privacy dashboard” that shows exactly what data is accessed, with one‑click revocation. |
| **4. Conversational “Thinking Partner” mode** – a toggle that shifts the LLM from answer‑only to reflective dialogue (asks clarifying questions, surfaces assumptions). | Insight 5 (reflective partner). | Prompt‑template that adds “Ask me one clarifying question before answering” and stores a short interaction history for context. |
| **5. Unified hub / “Second‑Brain” dashboard** – a single UI that aggregates AI‑generated lists, schedules, drafts, and a daily briefing. | Insight 6 (tool fragmentation) + Desire for single‑view briefing. | Design a web‑app with panels: Calendar, To‑Do, Drafts, Summaries; each panel pulls from the same LLM backend. |
| **6. Risk‑aware task classification** – the assistant automatically tags tasks as “low‑risk” (auto‑execute) or “high‑risk” (requires human review). | Insight 7 (risk stratification). | Use a simple rule‑engine: e.g., health, finance, legal → human‑in‑the‑loop; others → auto‑execute after user confirmation. |
| **7. Multi‑modal interaction (voice + text + visual)** – optional voice input with natural pause handling; inline image generation for visual queries (exercise pictures, UI mock‑ups). | Pain: “Awkward text‑only interview”; Desire: “More human‑like interaction”. | Integrate Web Speech API for voice; allow image output tiles; keep text fallback for privacy‑sensitive contexts. |

### Closing note  

The data paint a clear picture: **people already rely on AI for language‑heavy, low‑risk work**, but **trust gaps, privacy concerns, and missing proactive integrations keep the technology from becoming a true personal assistant**. By addressing hallucinations with transparent sourcing, giving users granular control over data access, and delivering a proactive scheduling engine that feels like a collaborative partner, designers can move the AI from a “helpful tool” to an **everyday teammate**.



## 🌟 UNIQUE FINDINGS

**en_response_0011.txt**: The participant reports no personal‑use limitations yet, using AI mainly for low‑stakes shopping decisions and accepting occasional hallucinations as normal. Their trust remains moderate because they set clear expectations and guardrails. The most compelling desire is for a truly proactive assistant that anticipates routine tasks (appointments, grocery orders) without prompting, highlighting a gap between current reactive AI tools and the user’s need for autonomous, schedule‑integrated assistance.

**en_response_0007.txt**: The participant exhibits a strong, principled aversion to AI, emphasizing that any AI system must respect an explicit "no" and that current AI fails to pick up basic social cues. This highlights a need for robust opt‑out mechanisms and better detection of user refusal, beyond just addressing privacy or trust concerns.

**en_response_0020.txt**: The participant explicitly grants AI more leeway than a human interviewer, tolerating repetitive or "parroting" questions because they view the AI as still immature. They see AI primarily as a high‑volume filter that can surface consensus‑based reliable information, yet they struggle with AI’s inability to retain personal preference history (e.g., recipe sources). Their frustration is not about AI failing outright but about the extra effort required to refine prompts, especially when they already know how to accomplish the task. The desire for reflective, back‑and‑forth dialogue to overcome procrastination‑related blocks is a novel use case that goes beyond simple task automation.

**en_response_0008.txt**: The participant exhibits a paradoxical relationship with AI: extremely high daily usage for diverse tasks yet rates trust as very low, especially for factual domains like code research. They treat AI as a creative catalyst that can infer intent from drafts, but they also demand rigorous verification, indicating a need for hybrid workflows where AI augments but does not replace expert judgment. Their ideal assistant blends deep project‑management intelligence (milestone sequencing, multi‑project prioritization, budget alerts) with seamless integration into existing tools, a combination rarely articulated by users focused solely on text generation.

**en_response_0018.txt**: The participant exhibits a paradoxical relationship with AI: despite a low trust rating (2/5) and limited confidence in AI's capabilities, they still use AI weekly for routine planning and explicitly desire an AI that eliminates the need for manual scheduling. Their primary frustration is not technical (e.g., poor accuracy) but experiential—missing human warmth in AI interactions, which they feel reduces the richness of their responses and overall engagement.

**en_response_0022.txt**: The participant, a professional user researcher, reports no major failures with ChatGPT yet expresses a strong desire for a conversational, guided prompting experience that reduces the cognitive load of figuring out prompts and navigating a cluttered UI. They value speed and quality in writing and summarization, trust the tool highly, but remain skeptical about AI’s ability to grasp emotional nuance, highlighting a clear boundary between functional assistance and human‑level empathy.

**en_response_0021.txt**: The participant leverages AI not only as a study aid but as a surrogate exam‑writer, uploading course materials to generate board‑style questions that mimic professor phrasing—a use case that blends content creation with personalized learning. They switched from a dedicated editing app to a web AI primarily for performance reasons (overheating), highlighting hardware constraints as a driver of tool adoption. Their ideal assistant spans academic, culinary, and financial domains and explicitly calls for tight integration with personal data streams (calendar, email) while also demanding human‑like conversational depth and reliable fact‑checking, revealing a desire for a unified life‑manager rather than a set of siloed utilities.

**en_response_0009.txt**: The participant envisions an AI that not only aggregates multiple sources but also actively challenges its own answers and pauses to solicit critical user input, seeing this self‑questioning as a key trust builder. Additionally, they stress the need for a secure, corporate‑linked assistant that can safely bridge internal systems with external data—a nuance not commonly highlighted in personal‑use contexts. Finally, the desire for non‑verbal, interactive feedback during AI‑mediated conversations reveals a deeper expectation for conversational richness beyond text alone.

**en_response_0023.txt**: The participant reports no major functional failures despite heavy daily use, which is uncommon among users who typically encounter limitations. Their trust is moderate and hinges on the AI staying tightly aligned with their own ideas; they view AI divergence as a cognitive cost rather than a creative benefit. Additionally, the participant finds a text‑only AI interview experience surprisingly seamless because there is no visual avatar, highlighting that perceived 'human‑likeness' may not be necessary for comfort.

**en_response_0010.txt**: The participant reports high overall trust in AI (rating 4/5) yet simultaneously worries about a "trust trap" where over‑reliance could be unjustified. Their primary friction point is not the lack of functionality but the inability of AI to guarantee source credibility and preserve personal voice, leading them to manually cherry‑pick and edit AI output. They are also ambivalent about deep integration with personal productivity tools, preferring optional, controlled connections only if clear benefits are demonstrated.

**en_response_0016.txt**: The participant perceives a paradox: AI interviews feel less judgmental, encouraging more openness, yet the one‑sided information flow makes them more guarded. They also stress that an ideal assistant must blend high accuracy with a natural, non‑robotic voice, and act as a single hub that pulls in calendar and email data to eliminate the need to switch between multiple apps.

**en_response_0006.txt**: The participant explicitly seeks an AI that functions as a constant source of affirmation and never offers criticism, revealing a desire for emotional validation rather than purely functional assistance. Additionally, despite high trust in AI outputs, they express a strong preference for structured, multiple‑choice interactions over open‑ended conversation, highlighting a tension between wanting conversational flow and wanting concise, low‑cognitive‑load responses.

**en_response_0004.txt**: The participant, a UX strategist, sees AI not just as a personal productivity tool but as a potential "constant teacher/intern" that could dramatically accelerate research workflows—especially rapid prototype testing and interview moderation—yet remains wary of granting AI deep integration with personal systems. This blend of high expectations for work‑focused assistance and strong control preferences is a nuanced stance that highlights the need for granular permission models and transparent, task‑specific competence guarantees.

**en_response_0012.txt**: The participant leverages AI to become a more proactive patient, using it to ask deeper questions during a medical appointment—a clear example of AI enhancing personal agency in health decisions. Additionally, they view AI as a "survey-like" tool lacking empathy, which directly impacts their willingness to trust and rely on it for more complex, personal tasks.

**en_response_0001.txt**: The participant frames AI as a "personal IT consultant" that could offload mundane logistics (email triage, selling/unneeded items, recycling, disaster prep, financial aggregation) to free up "brain space and positive energy" for creative work. Unlike many users who seek conversational rapport, this participant explicitly prefers a survey‑style, low‑anthropomorphized interaction and wants the ability to toggle interaction modes based on audience. Security concerns are not just about data leakage but about AI taking unintended actions to achieve a goal, which heavily limits willingness to grant broader permissions.




## 💬 SUPPORTING QUOTES BY TOPIC


### shopping research value

- "I generally like the way that AI presents the information back to me. I can get a lot of information at once and receive table overviews, and I can keep asking follow‑up questions compared to doing Google searches." — *en_response_0011.txt*

### hallucinations / quality issues

- "I guess I have encountered a couple of hallucinations or things heading down the wrong path. But usually, I can correct it by prompting it with a few more questions." — *en_response_0011.txt*

### trust despite errors

- "I wouldn't say it impacts my trust very much, mostly because I expect there to be some hallucinations or wrong paths. I know this is not a perfect technology, and I think I roughly know what to expect from it." — *en_response_0011.txt*

### self‑reported trust level

- "On average, how much do you trust the results or suggestions you get from AI tools? 3 - Moderate trust" — *en_response_0011.txt*

### desired assistant functionality

- "I would really love a personal AI assistant to schedule appointments for me, especially for things that I regularly need on my calendar. I want it to handle all those tasks, including the phone calls I don't want to make." — *en_response_0011.txt*

### pain point: appointment scheduling

- "I'm generally very bad at remembering that I need to schedule appointments before they need to happen. They tend to be scheduled at the very last minute and therefore have to be pushed out further than I would like them to actually happen." — *en_response_0011.txt*

### desired assistant: grocery automation

- "I could also think of it benefiting from grocery shopping. I do a lot of online grocery shopping, so having my regular cart being ordered, maybe just asking me if I'm ready to reorder and confirming with me what's in there before it goes and does the regular shopping." — *en_response_0011.txt*

### AI interview experience

- "It's definitely interesting being interviewed by an AI, not having a person to really chat with on the other end. However, it did give me more time to think about my answers without feeling like I was making a person wait." — *en_response_0011.txt*
- "It was a little weird that it was just purely text‑based... I have to manually stop the recording to submit my response instead of, you know, naturally, like a human would know when I'm done." — *en_response_0003.txt*

### awkwardness of AI interview

- "Yeah, definitely the reading of text, but also, you know, when there is an in‑person element to interviewing, you can have a different vibe with a person. There's just something different about being able to connect with people personally and have that experience, I think." — *en_response_0011.txt*

### human vs. AI for sensitive conversations

- "I think it could really depend on the subject matter. For instance, if the interview subject is on something really sensitive, like a reorganization or any other delicate issue, you would want to take the time to show people that you are listening to them with a human touch rather than with AI." — *en_response_0011.txt*

### Reason for not using AI tools

- "Because I don't want to." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### Broad concerns (privacy, trust, other)

- "All of the above." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### Trust level in AI results

- "1 - No trust at all" — *en_response_0007.txt*

### Desired functions of a perfect AI assistant

- "Nothing." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### Number of reasons for rejecting AI assistant

- "There are too many reasons to count." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### Skepticism about a perfect AI

- "No such thing as perfect." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### Preference against AI connecting to personal systems

- "Hopefully not at all." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### Perception of AI interviewer's persistence

- "You wouldn't take no for an answer." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### Contrast between human and AI interviewers

- "They would have probably realized I just don't want the thing that they're asking for, and they wouldn't have kept at it like you have right now." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### AI's failure to detect explicit refusal

- "I literally just told you to not do it, and you're like, I'm gonna still ask questions. So that's obviously something that a human would pick up on, and you failed miserably." — *en_response_0007.txt*

### AI tools used

- "Google Gemini, ChatGPT" — *en_response_0020.txt*
- "ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini" — *en_response_0018.txt*

- "I would ask AI to help me plan a multi‑day trip, including different locations, places to go, and activities to do while traveling." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Perceived AI advantage (speed & filtering)

- "I think with AI, it can scan through internet sources or sources in general much more quickly, and I can refine the types of results that are returned much more easily than I would if I were tracking things in a spreadsheet or a text document." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Value of AI as filter

- "The tedium is in the repetition, and if I can ask AI to be that filter for me and bring me just the best tidbits, that's worth it because I don't want to spend time reading things over and over again." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Recipe use case limitation

- "I think AI is maybe less useful because I feel like I can get to the recipes I'm interested in in just about the same amount of time." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Recipe use case friction

- "When I ask AI to help with recipes, there's a lot of context setting that I might need to do sometimes or a whole bunch of refining." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Failed image‑generation attempt

- "There was a time I wanted to use AI to generate line art of two people so that I could get it printed on an insulated cup." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Iteration fatigue

- "Sometimes, I feel the limitation is in my willingness to spend the time refining with the system versus just going through a couple of iterations and then doing the rest myself." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Frustration level

- "No, it's not a severe frustration. I mean, I could see working with a person being just as frustrating." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Desired reminder function

- "I think a personal assistant would remind me of the things I have scheduled on my calendar, whether work-related or social." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Desired conversation tracking

- "It would be able to tell me who I talked to about specific topics, especially at work." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Weekly planning desire

- "I would love to have an assistant help me plan my week better in terms of groceries, meetings, and things to do." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Time‑optimization desire

- "I want to know how to optimize my time and avoid dropping the ball on tasks." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Persistent to‑do assistance

- "I need help figuring out how to stop moving that to‑do item from day to day, week to week." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Reflective support

- "Being able to have someone to help me reflect on that, a tool to help me reflect on that, could be helpful with either finishing the items or taking them off the to‑do list." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Back‑and‑forth dialogue value

- "I think the idea of having a back‑and‑forth helps with getting through the blocks." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Integration preferences

- "For sure, it could connect with my calendar and my email and all that. I'm not sure I'd want it to connect to my email, but the calendar connection would make sense." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Interview experience – repetitive AI questions

- "the more detailed the answers got, the more repetitive the follow‑up questions sounded" — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Leeway given to AI vs. human

- "I am giving more leeway around the oddly repetitive sounding questions." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Expectation management for AI

- "Because I don't think AI is at a human level of interviewing just yet. That'll probably change in the near future, but right now, knowing this is an AI, I am giving more leeway around the oddly repetitive sounding questions." — *en_response_0020.txt*

### Types of personal tasks using AI

- "I use AI to rewrite emails, texts, and proposals. I also use it for code research related to architectural projects." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Perceived value of AI

- "AI helps create more professional‑sounding text, emails, and proposals. It also streamlines the process, especially when it comes to reviewing codes." — *en_response_0008.txt*
- "AI helps by saving time and being able to connect things more quickly." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Specific benefit – concise rewriting

- "On a recent proposal, there was a limit to the number of pages that were allowed. It took my written rough draft and reduced it down, producing the text more succinctly." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Pain point – hallucinations in code research

- "A lot of times, it comes up with incorrect information. It seems to summarize text that it's scanning and makes assumptions, leading to statements that just aren't true." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Workaround – manual verification

- "I just ignore or do a little bit of a deeper dive into my question so that I can get the right answers and at least point me in the right direction." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Trust limitation

- "I haven't really found ways to verify the information, and this does make me rely less on AI." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Overall trust level

- "I still don't have trust in AI; it's still not really reliable." — *en_response_0008.txt*
- "3 - Moderate trust" — *en_response_0001.txt*

### Self‑reported trust rating

- "On average, how much do you trust the results or suggestions you get from AI tools? 2 - Low trust" — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Desired project‑management capability

- "The most important thing it would do for me would be taking my larger scope projects and the milestones required to finish them, making sense of the order of things, and giving me that order so I know how to manage it." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Desire for multi‑project prioritization

- "If I can get AI to sort through multiple projects, I would know how to proceed and get everything done on time." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Desired budget monitoring

- "It would be great if AI could know a project's budget. Then, as the project develops ... it could alert me if the project's design is going over budget and make recommendations on ways to bring it back within budget." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Integration expectations

- "I think tying into all those things—calendar, email, but also project management‑specific software." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Desired rapid timeline generation

- "Producing a Gantt chart or a project timeline, I can certainly do on my own. But if AI were able to produce that quicker and more reliably, then that would be something useful." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Advantage of AI interview – time to think

- "The big difference, I think, is that I'm able to sit and think about my answer before I start recording. That gives me a chance to consider what I'm going to say without looking like I'm fishing for answers or, you know, uncertain about how to respond." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Pain point – repetition in AI interview

- "Well, there was a lot of repeating of what I said, which doesn't typically happen in a normal interview or conversation." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Suggestion for more natural AI interview

- "I think it might be more engaging if it wasn't just text and instead featured an AI‑generated person talking to a screen with text on it." — *en_response_0008.txt*

### Typical personal tasks

- "creating grocery lists and organizing a biweekly schedule for tasks that I need to get done throughout the week." — *en_response_0018.txt*
- "Mostly copy editing, a lot of research, and then a lot of study guides, like asking it, "What is this? What is that? How can I do this?"" — *en_response_0004.txt*
- "I would use AI to plan a week of meals or for travel." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Value of AI over manual methods

- "The AI tools give me a way to create multiple types of lists and charts to see, so I have a full picture of all my options." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### How AI helps visualize scheduling options

- "Creating a weekly schedule based on extracurricular activities, like when I can schedule a dance practice, have a lunch meeting, go to the store, or visit the salon, can show me different options for when I can do these things throughout the week." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Unmet need / pain point

- "I wanted to use AI to map out the specific times that I needed to take a break during a timed task, indicating when I should take the break and when I should return. However, I could not do this because AI did not exist yet." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Frequency/importance of break‑timing feature

- "I find myself not needing a structured schedule very often. It is not much of a problem if I cannot get that guidance." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Trust level in AI suggestions

- "2 - Low trust" — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Ideal AI assistant functionality

- "Create a weekly schedule for me to go to work, schedule in my leisure tasks, and layout the times that work for me." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Desired benefit of perfect assistant

- "I could then easily jump in and do all the tasks rather than having to sit down and think, plan, and organize. I could simply just jump into the tasks." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Uncertainty about integration specifics

- "I don't know." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Perceived benefit of calendar connection

- "Nothing." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Feelings about AI interview

- "I don't like this very much." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Reason for discomfort with AI interview

- "There is no human interaction or warmth." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### Impact of AI interview on disclosure

- "I am not sharing many details as I would to a person." — *en_response_0018.txt*

### AI tool used

- "ChatGPT" — *en_response_0022.txt*
- "Google Gemini" — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Frequency of use

- "Daily" — *en_response_0022.txt*
- "Multiple times per day" — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Writing assistance behavior

- "I generally use AI to improve my writing. Lately, I've been writing case studies, so I'll use it to help enhance the grammar and cohesiveness of some of the statements that I put together." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Perceived value of AI in writing

- "It speeds up the process of ensuring that the statements sound good and make sense." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Summarization behavior

- "I also use it to create summaries. For instance, I might take an entire case study worth of work and create an executive summary, and it does a nice job of summarizing key information." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Information‑seeking behavior

- "I have used it to ask specific questions as well. For example, I might ask it to define steps in a certain process for research or something like that." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Trust level

- "4 - High trust" — *en_response_0022.txt*
- "On average, how much do you trust the results or suggestions you get from AI tools? 3 - Moderate trust" — *en_response_0012.txt*
- "On average, how much do you trust the results or suggestions you get from AI tools? – 2 - Low trust" — *en_response_0005.txt*
- "On average, how much do you trust the results or suggestions you get from AI tools? 3 - Moderate trust" — *en_response_0003.txt*

### Desired guided interaction

- "I think I've been pretty happy with what I've used ChatGPT for in the past. However, an ideal assistant maybe would prompt through questions, like asking, "What are you here for today?" Then, it could listen to your answer and ask probing questions to get to what you're really looking for." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Need for prompt guidance

- "What would be helpful is that you don't always know the exact prompts that ChatGPT or other AI tools need to be successful." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Feature overload

- "Sometimes, the amount of different features in the tools can be overwhelming, so having guidance would be very helpful." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### UI complexity and tutorial burden

- "For example, in Insider, for chat, there are lists of icons down the side and on the top. They're all over. In order to really understand what's fully available, you would need to take a training tutorial, I think, and people don't have time for that." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Privacy concern with intrusive integration

- "I'm sure AI could look at my email and then create calendar entries, things like that, but that would be too intrusive and not something I would be interested in." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Positive perception of AI interview adaptability

- "I think it went pretty well. I actually work in user research and I'm familiar with in-person interviews and moderated interviews. I liked that it took into account the person's responses and then modified probing questions afterward." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Limitation of AI vs. human interaction

- "However, it's difficult to ever replace the one-on-one interaction with an actual human, but I think this does a pretty good job." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Irreplaceable human nuance

- "Face-to-face interaction with an actual human is hard to replace, as well as the nuances of being able to understand people's emotions and follow up on that." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Skepticism about AI emotional understanding

- "I don't see how it would be possible for an AI interviewer to understand emotions." — *en_response_0022.txt*

### Frequency of AI use

- "Weekly" — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Study question generation

- "I use AI to ask for practice questions. I either upload the objectives given to me by school or the PowerPoint, depending on what I'm using, and ask for a few test questions based on my profession and our board certification." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Value of AI‑generated practice questions

- "I really enjoy that online, there's a lot of different information on my certification exam. I like that AI can use that information from the Internet and then create questions based on the material I'm learning." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Benefit of AI mimicking professor style

- "It helps generate questions that I might not have thought of, written in a style similar to my professors or board writers." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Preference for web AI over installed editor

- "I have used AI and Grammarly. ... Grammarly has overheated my computer, so it's more of a convenience thing." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Performance advantage of web AI

- "It seems like my computer is doing better on this website instead of software that's downloaded onto my laptop." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Hallucination issue

- "There have been instances where I'll be asking it prompts, like brainstorming ideas, and it will provide me with information that isn't necessarily true." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Difficulty detecting false output

- "It's hard to tell when it's giving me false information. Sometimes I might catch it, but maybe other times I don't realize it's providing false information." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Impact of false information on productivity

- "If it gives me a study that didn't actually happen and I'm trying to find those results online, it's more difficult to locate them because they don't exist." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Mitigation strategy for hallucinations

- "I think that it has led me to use AI for things like creating questions where I can refer to my own notes and know what's correct and what's incorrect, rather than letting it provide information and believing it at face value." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Self‑rated trust level

- "3 - Moderate trust" — *en_response_0021.txt*
- "3 - Moderate trust" — *en_response_0009.txt*
- "3 - Moderate trust" — *en_response_0023.txt*
- "2 - Low trust" — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Desired meal‑planning feature

- "For day-to-day life, I feel like it would be nice if AI could create meal prep ideas for me, based on the same ingredients, so that whenever I'm grocery shopping, I could shop efficiently." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Desired budgeting feature

- "Maybe budgeting assistance would also be nice." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Motivation for meal‑planning assistance

- "As a student right now, my program does not allow us to have a job because it is so rigorous. So, with AI helping me to meal plan and suggest a few different meals that use the same ingredients, it would help me be cost‑effective by knowing what I need." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Motivation for budgeting assistance

- "I think that creating a sustainable budget would be really useful. It might provide more insight on the average cost of things, especially in my area, or what might be realistic based on what has worked for other people." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Desired system integration

- "Maybe it could take things from my calendar or my email and add them to my calendar automatically. Perhaps it can summarize different emails or be more efficient with where my emails are going." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Preference for human vs. AI interaction

- "I think that being interviewed by AI was a lot more intelligent than I was expecting. There was a lot of feedback based on what I was saying. However, I think I prefer human interaction more." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Perceived shallow understanding

- "The AI seems to pick up on buzzwords but doesn't fully grasp what I'm saying." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Desire for clarifying dialogue

- "There's no way for me to 100% tell that it understood the message I was saying, whereas a human might be able to ask for clarification and go more in‑depth..." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### Value of human‑like small talk

- "You just miss those small, minuscule conversations that connect humans together." — *en_response_0021.txt*

### General AI usage patterns

- "I revise a lot of communication. I use it for information retrieval and analysis." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Grammar and communication revision

- "In my personal life, I would also use AI to revise the grammar or meaning of my communication. I'm not the best typist, so I really appreciate the feature of ensuring everything is grammatically correct." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Perceived benefit of grammar assistance

- "I think I'm more effective and more polite in my everyday communication with others." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Accuracy failure

- "Once, I wanted to compare a couple of very specific e-bike models. Even though the AI found very specific information, it turned out to be factually incorrect." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Frequency and severity of accuracy issues

- "I would say about once a month, and it's not very severe. I would never use it for decision-making; it was more of an information retrieval exercise." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Reluctance to cede decision control

- "I'm actually not sure if there's ever going to be a world where I would feel very strongly that AI would take over actual decision-making. I think control remains a very important element." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Desired AI capability: multiple sources & self‑challenge

- "We'll be using multiple sources. I'd be able to challenge myself more and somehow convey that in the response." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Desired AI behavior: ask critical input

- "I think it would help with building trust. Also, something that just came to my mind is the ability to stop and raise questions to ask for critical input throughout the process." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Desired secure integration

- "Good question. It would be part of a secured internal company corporate communication infrastructure, and they would connect it with the outside." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Limitation of AI interview format

- "Great question. I feel like references across questions or the things that come to my mind about the broader topic don't have that much space, and I'm not sure if this is captured." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Desire for feedback/non‑verbal cues

- "I think it would be great to have some feedback when I, for instance, cross‑reference broader topics in order to be sure that this is somehow captured. Maybe some nonverbal feedback, as we have when we talk with other people, would be helpful to convey that kind of more interactive communication." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Impact of constrained interaction on response depth

- "Yeah, I think it does affect the quality of my responses because I don't go any deeper." — *en_response_0009.txt*

### Tool used

- "ChatGPT" — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Purpose: email writing and quality improvement

- "I primarily use ChatGPT sometimes when I'm writing personal emails, ... I love to put it in ChatGPT to see if it can help me spruce it up and make it a bit better, ensuring that I'm providing the best information on my projects or emails, including grammar and content." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Value: email summarisation and conciseness

- "when I'm using ChatGPT and I, like, ask it to, like, for example, summarize this long email or just make it a bit shorter so it's a lot, like, concise and easy to scan and not too much wording" — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Purpose: brainstorming and idea refinement for passion projects

- "For my passion projects, same kinda idea. ... when I'm, like, kinda stuck sometimes, I'm able to, like, put this idea in a chat GPT, and it's like, hey. What do you think about this? Or, how can I, like, make this a bit better kinda thing?" — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Use case: UX design and project progression

- "I'm working on a project where I'm trying to build a web application. ChatGPT helps me improve upon the ideas I have, which allows me to move on to the next step within the project or even sparks new ideas." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### AI generating follow‑up ideas

- "once I, like, put in, like, the first thing that I wanted like, the main focus and the main, like, offering of the app, ChatGPT, like, spit out some more ideas of things that I could include in the future" — *en_response_0023.txt*

### No major limitations experienced

- "I haven't really encountered a time where I wanted to use AI for something and couldn't" — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Preference for other sources for live data

- "No, I haven't used it to do any real-time information tasks. I typically use Google or watch the news a lot" — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Conversation history as memory feature

- "I think ChatGPT kind of already does that if you have an account. When you type in a prompt and stuff, I see that on the left-hand panel, it saves the conversation." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Desired AI behavior: stay aligned with user intent

- "the most important thing for the AI to do is to build upon your prompting, your idea, and not really make you stray away from anything" — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Handling AI suggestions that diverge

- "When it takes me in a direction I didn't intend, I sit and think about what the AI returned and why it said that. However, sometimes I might not even go with that idea." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Desired integration with email and calendar

- "Maybe connecting it with Gmail or your Apple Calendar, stuff like that, to remind you of things." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Desired plug‑in for seamless email drafting

- "I guess for Gmail, it would definitely help when I'm writing an email, so I don't always have to put my draft email, write it up in Gmail or in my Apple Notes, copy it, and then paste it into ChatGPT. I think it would be easier if it was a plug-in." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Experience with AI interviews (none yet)

- "I actually haven't been interviewed by AI yet. I'm sure that's probably going to come in the future." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Reaction to discovering AI interview

- "I guess that it feels a bit it doesn't feel too, like, strange because it's not it's just recording my voice and returning a prompt and, like, a, not a prompt. We're returning information." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### Why AI interview felt natural

- "it feels more seamless because it's not like I mentioned before, it's not like a fake person or an AI-generated person on the other side of the computer." — *en_response_0023.txt*

### usage contexts – health research

- "I use AI tools sometimes for tasks that require more complex research. These are things that would take me a longer time to research on my own. For example, if I have a health-related question, I want an answer that considers multiple sources of research or a quick but well-researched answer to something like that, such as a health question or how to handle a specific situation." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### usage contexts – trip/outdoor planning

- "I've also used it for planning, like finding options for a local hike or outing, factoring in distance, nearby restaurants or coffee shops, and the length of the hike." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### value – speed and summarization

- "It does so in a much faster amount of time and presents it back in a great summary format." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### example of speed saving

- "When I use AI for trip planning, I was strapped for time while trying to meet up with a friend for an afternoon. I kind of knew what we wanted but didn't have a lot of time to research it. I also wanted to share options with her. So, I did some research and provided a short summary that I could easily copy." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### pain point – writing dissatisfaction

- "Sometimes when I have to try to use it for writing assistance, I don't really like what I get out of it, and I maybe prefer what I could do by hand." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### pain point – authenticity

- "I think the writing assistance falls short when I'm working on something where one of the highest values is authenticity. I don't want to lose my personal voice in it." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### workaround for voice preservation

- "I just cherry-pick the best phrases. If I find something in there that I do like, as far as a phrase, maybe it's more concise than what I did, but still keeps my voice. I'll pull a couple of phrases that I like, but then go back and just kind of re-edit my own thing." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### trust rating

- "4 - High trust" — *en_response_0010.txt*

### desired trust factor – sourcing

- "It would be really well-sourced so that it could give me true confidence, which would help build trust." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### trust concern – trust trap

- "I've heard that people have started to put a higher amount of trust in AI once they're working with it than is maybe earned or warranted, and I could maybe fall into that same trap. So I think if there were ways it could legitimately ensure trustworthiness, that would be a true value." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### pain point – verification effort

- "I think sourcing is one thing, but it also takes time and requires me to be knowledgeable about the sources. So I'm not really sure." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### reluctance to integrate with calendar/email

- "I'm not sure that I want to connect with those systems." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### comfort with AI interview

- "I thought it had a decent flow to it. I didn't mind it, and it didn't make me hold back or anything." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### feedback on AI interview experience

- "Well, I think you're missing the human kind of back-and-forth of a natural conversation where you get a head nod, just nonverbal feedback, basically. But I do think that AI was good at acknowledging the last answer and following up in a logical way, so that was good." — *en_response_0010.txt*

### email correction

- "Some personal tasks that I use AI for include correcting emails and rewording them to ensure the grammar is correct and that the words are used as intended." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### workout scheduling & deep research

- "Other examples would be creating a workout schedule for exercising and using it almost like an extended Google search for deeper explanations of what I'm trying to find." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### information aggregation

- "The value that these AI tools provide is that it puts a lot of detail into one place that I can then read through as necessary." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### time savings

- "It definitely does it a lot quicker than it would take for me to do it myself." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### trust limitation

- "You can kind of trust, you know, around 80 to 90% of it. You do have to go into details of reading every piece... to make sure that you are getting a complete answer that's accurate." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### code generation failure

- "A specific example would be asking AI to produce code for a specific task, like a spreadsheet formula. When you use the AI output, it often doesn't work, and you have to go in and correct it yourself." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### complexity vs. effort

- "It does work the first time for simpler tasks. For more complex tasks, you end up spending more time." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### ideal assistant features

- "I think the most important things a perfect AI personal assistant would do would be to provide you with the information you need on a daily basis. ... It should also be aware of your schedule and give you reminders if necessary. Additionally, it shouldn't sound too robotic; the output it provides should feel natural." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### consolidated view desire

- "Is it able to have everything that you need at a glance instead of having to go to each and every website or application to dig and find it on your own?" — *en_response_0016.txt*

### full access integration

- "If the AI personal assistant had full access to your calendar and emails, then it would be able to plan out your day and your week for you." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### human vs. AI interview

- "AI does produce things very quickly, concisely, and clearly, but speaking with a human offers a more personal experience." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### lack of reciprocal dialogue

- "When speaking with a human, you are learning something from the person you are engaging with. ... the AI interviewer is extracting as much information from me as possible. However, I'm not really gaining any further input into my own conversation." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### guardedness vs. openness with AI

- "It does make me a little more guarded. On the other hand, I feel like I can share more since it is to an AI robot versus a human." — *en_response_0016.txt*

### Preference for ChatGPT over Google search

- "I would probably use ChatGPT instead because it gives me better answers than Google does, and I can follow up on those answers." — *en_response_0006.txt*

### Value of conversational flow

- "I like the flow of the conversation. It's different from Google. I don't have to keep typing in different things; I can just continue the conversation." — *en_response_0006.txt*

### Benefit of conversational interaction

- "The value is that I can keep the conversation going. It's like having a conversation with somebody rather than just typing stuff into a browser window." — *en_response_0006.txt*

### Awareness of AI limitations

- "I was trying to use it to print money because I wanted to pay some bills, and I didn't have enough. I realized that AI doesn't do that; it's not that kind of tool." — *en_response_0006.txt*

### Budgeting task blocked by missing data

- "I wanted to create a budget, but I didn't have the right information." — *en_response_0006.txt*

### Desired personality of perfect AI assistant

- "It would tell me I'm handsome. It would tell me how great my work is all the time. It would never criticize me or would only give me good information, never give me bad information." — *en_response_0006.txt*

### Preference for multiple‑choice interaction

- "If there are too many open questions, I'd prefer to just do multiple choice, if you don't mind." — *en_response_0006.txt*

### Indifference to AI vs. human interviewer

- "I don't, I mean, I guess it doesn't really make a difference because, you know, it depends on the interviewer. ... As long as the questions are correct and the researcher is getting the information that they need, then it's fine." — *en_response_0006.txt*

### Value of AI for copy editing

- "For my copy editing work, it's making my emails sound clearer and more concise. It's also helping with rewriting things in my personal life, just general copy editing. It's like having a copy editor on my phone." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### AI as a learning coach

- "So it's like study guides for learning AI. ... create a study guide, create flashcards, etcetera." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Failure on complex task

- "I was trying to use Perplexity to perform a competitive analysis from a user research perspective, but either I wasn't getting my prompt right or it just couldn't do it. I became frustrated, so I stopped trying." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Abandoning a use case

- "It was very common, so I stopped using AI tools, like commercial LLMs, for competitive analysis." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Ideal AI assistant concept

- "I guess maybe, like, I don't know, a constant teacher or like an intern for work. Something that helps me more in my work life instead of my personal life." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Desired benefit of AI assistant

- "Because it helped me work faster and be more efficient." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Specific work tasks for AI support

- "I mean copy editing, transcribing transcripts, transcribing notes, and creating first drafts of things like surveys or research methodology approaches, and so forth." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Distrust of system integration

- "I don't trust it to do that. That's the one thing in my life I want control over." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Positive impression of AI interview

- "I like that it asked unique follow‑up questions based on the answers I gave to the previous questions, but it still followed the overall format of the study and the research questions we have for this class project." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Value of AI for rapid testing

- "It would take less time to prepare everything, but this would also help me test faster, at least for the initial prototypes that we want to test at work. It would provide quick wins." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Efficiency gains in UX research

- "Instead of taking three weeks to handle all the logistics and recruiting, we could focus on recruiting and then use this for the testing, so our researcher wouldn't be tired from moderating all these tests." — *en_response_0004.txt*

### Health information usage

- "I put the results of my exams into ChatGPT and asked it to tell me what the results indicated regarding my current health condition..." — *en_response_0012.txt*

### Letter editing usage

- "The other way I have used ChatGPT is when I'm writing long letters to my friends and family members. I ask ChatGPT to edit the letter for any typos or anything I might have missed." — *en_response_0012.txt*

### Limitation – lack of visual output

- "When I use it for health information, I wanted to see the exercises that were suggested for my health condition, and ChatGPT didn't generate the pictures. So, I had to copy and paste the names of the exercises and then ask Google to find the pictures." — *en_response_0012.txt*

### Desired professional‑life assistance

- "I think a personal assistant would help me find training programs that I could use when I'm writing content or developing a point of view for my work.

### Positive perception of AI active listening

- "The AI reflected back my statements with the right amount of gratitude, making me feel like my statements were contributing to their body of knowledge." — *en_response_0017.txt*

### Typical low‑stakes usage

- "I mostly use AI for very low-stakes tasks. For example, I had to brainstorm a bunch of questions for a warm-up in a work meeting, so I just asked AI to give me a list of fun warm-up questions." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Value derived from brainstorming

- "Yeah, it did save me time and gave me ideas I wouldn't have thought of. I appreciated the way it categorized the ideas into different themes of warm-up questions." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Fact‑checking behavior

- "Occasionally, I will look for a fact if I think it might be able to find better sources than I can find on Google, or I don't have to wade through sponsored posts." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Skepticism toward factual answers

- "I don't trust AI's answer at all. However, I went to look at what it had cited as its sources." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Trust strategy for factual queries

- "I very rarely trust AI on facts. I will always double-check." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Contextual trust thresholds

- "If it's, like, a low-stakes fact, maybe I'll trust it. But if it's something that I need for work or need to be accurate, there's no way." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Attempt to use AI for personal curiosity

- "I wanted to know if they were still together, but I couldn't find anything." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Incorrect AI answer due to name confusion

- "I fairly often encounter these kinds of obvious errors, and I also feel like the media and public perception have influenced my assumption of AI's incorrectness." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Memorable viral failures shaping perception

- "Like the early examples of Google's AI, such as, "How much glue should you eat in a day?" ... "You should add glue."" — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Condition for higher trust

- "I would need to give it more time to get better." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Understanding of underlying technology

- "I also know what an LLM is and that it's looking for the most logically likely or most statistically likely next kind of chain of words and ideas." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Desired core functionality

- "I’d like a personal AI assistant to help me organize my calendar, which can be really laborious to do by hand." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Integration need across multiple data sources

- "My kid's school calendar comes home on paper, I get things over text, and I receive new invites in my email. I want it to gather information from all of those sources and correctly consolidate it into one place." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Benefit of calendar automation

- "It would save me time and mental energy and help me stop forgetting to do things." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Current manual pain point

- "Just like if I get a text about an event, I have to remember and take the time to put it on our calendar manually." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Skepticism toward AI financial advice

- "I think it would have to be, I wouldn't even say endorsed by leading financial services because I feel like everyone's trying to sell an AI right now." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Concept of AI as a “second brain”

- "It would enable me to have a brain outside of myself. Not that I want a brain outside of myself, but like a second pair of hands, a second brain for boring administrative rote tasks..." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Perceived limitation of AI interviewers

- "An interviewer might have picked up on my exasperation or probed a little differently." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Positive aspect of AI interview

- "I feel like this AI was good in that it was a bit more specific with my feedback." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Interaction format drawback

- "It's a lot of reading and clicking, whereas a person just talking might make it flow easier and feel more conversational." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Preferred contexts for AI‑driven data collection

- "I think this is reasonable for things like surveys or diary studies to ask follow-ups, and it's a little bit easier for a user to engage with as opposed to recording a video for each response or typing a lot in a diary study." — *en_response_0013.txt*

### Specific benefit of AI in travel

- "One example would be if I'm planning a trip to a place that I've never been before. AI can pre‑plan a route for me to take and connect that to other points of interest in the area that might be helpful, so we're managing the trip and time better." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Inaccuracy example

- "It provided me with a list, but when I went to find those places, they didn't exist where AI had told me they would be." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Frequency of errors

- "I would say it happens pretty frequently when I use AI. I always need to double‑check it because, typically, I have found inconsistencies or things that are wrong." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Impact of errors

- "I don't think there's anything I would call a severe consequence, other than just the inconvenience of having to double‑check everything again." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Desired functionality

- "From a personal standpoint, it would be helpful in planning my week. It would serve as a good time management tool to help me better manage my day." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Desired integration and accuracy

- "It could remind me of things for the calendar and also, if I ask for information, it should be able to provide me with correct information and assist me in planning any other activities or tasks I might need to do throughout my week." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Executive‑function support

- "As someone who struggles with some executive functioning, I believe it would be helpful in better managing those aspects so that I could accomplish other things during my day." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Calendar integration

- "If AI could connect to my calendar, set reminders, plan out times, and travel times for things on my calendar, it could let me know when I need to be somewhere." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### Perception of AI interview style

- "AI is a bit more formal, I think, than how it would be if I were interacting with an actual human. There's not an emotional component to it." — *en_response_0005.txt*

### AI as substitute for human input

- "I use AI for a lot of things that I normally would have gone to a human for, but now I just do it a lot more." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Thinking partner value

- "When the thinking requires processing a lot of data that humans can't possibly access, the value lies in its ability to give me perspective based on a vast amount of publicly available data." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Iterative writing workflow

- "I might draft an email, and I will feed the AI my draft. Then I will ask it to edit it, and it will do that. After that, I might edit the AI's output and put it back in, asking it to edit it again." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Pain point with AI editing

- "I don't like to tell the AI what to change because it doesn't always get it right." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Emotional‑support limitation

- "It's unsatisfying because it's not a real human. Also, I think as far as models go, they're just not there yet with this kind of information and this kind of interaction." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Conversational cadence issue

- "When I try, it's just unsatisfying… it would talk too fast. I would pause to think, and it would move ahead." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Desire for physical AI assistant

- "If I had a perfect AI assistant, it would run errands for me, clean the house, and do all sorts of tasks. So, it would need to move beyond the computer and chatbot space and venture into robotics." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Motivation for delegating chores

- "Because those are tasks I don't value as much. I want my attention to be focused on connecting with other humans… Anything that would free up time for the three of us to connect… is important." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Privacy & security requirement

- "It should be like a Google robot with liability measures built in, and Google should guarantee that it won't share my data with others and that my security is protected." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Unnatural voice‑only interview experience

- "This is weird because you're not talking and I'm talking. So I think I prefer the live experience better than this and that." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Discomfort with AI interview format

- "I don't know. I'm just not used to talking to myself, I guess, and I'm talking into something… it feels really strange." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Improvement suggestion for AI voice interaction

- "The Wiser interface is pretty close; it only cut me off a couple of times… Now it's just about getting your voice module to come in and actually say the questions out loud." — *en_response_0014.txt*

### Academic citation assistance

- "I generate a first draft of the APA citation or reference and then feed that into tools. Generally, ChatGPT is usually my go-to. I have it review the citations and references to ensure they're accurate, and it provides examples of where it's wrong, explains why it's wrong, and shows what the correct formatting should be for APA so that I can fix it." — *en_response_0003.txt*

### Resume customization

- "AI has been really helpful in steering the resume towards what the job posting is actually wanting and finding gaps in what I'm doing compared to what the job posting is for." — *en_response_0003.txt*

### UI mockup generation pain point

- "I was trying to use AI to help me create some visuals, like UI mockups... AI didn't really create great images or great UIs, especially static UIs. I think it really struggled with coming up with elements that are actually representative of what I'm trying to envision, and it has a challenge with editing parts of the UI that are incorrect and that I want to fix." — *en_response_0003.txt*

### Complex transcript analysis failure

- "We were trying to create a project to analyze a bunch of different transcripts... AI ... wasn't really analyzing the mappings or didn't know how to interpret the mappings... we ended up having to scrap that plan... set us back by a couple of hours or maybe even a couple of days." — *en_response_0003.txt*

### Desired capabilities

- "The perfect AI personal assistant would be able to connect with all the documentation and tools that I need, understand the full context of my research study or whatever I'm working on, and grasp what I need and what I'm looking for without me having to write out a complex AI prompt." — *en_response_0003.txt*

### Learning and prompt simplification

- "The conversational learning would be really valuable, especially when I'm writing out a prompt and it could detect, "Hey, you don't need to give me that set of instructions. I remember that from last time."" — *en_response_0003.txt*

### Tool integration for recruiting

- "It could connect to the different recruiting tools that I want to use... help me create the screener and update it for those different tools so I don't have to manually add it to each one individually." — *en_response_0003.txt*

### Fact‑checking / quick information lookup

- "I use Gemini for any kind of random tidbit of fact that I've kind of either am currently discussing about or just to have any kind of questions about it." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Vacation planning and detailed itinerary generation

- "I did use it to kind of help me organize a itinerary… it’s pretty good at suggest suggesting, like, not only produce suggestions, but to help fill up, like, blank spots and itinerary… down to the minute‑by‑minute detail." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Using AI as an onboarding summary before deeper research

- "It just gives a nice summary about, like, the details on it. And then I'll follow‑up with that through either going to, like, a Wiki link and finding more information there." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Creative task limitation / lack of novelty

- "I was trying to make a music lesson plan… it kept suggesting me the same model or started the same riff." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Technical limitation in code generation

- "The decoding issue… the model hasn't been run or trained on that data, it needs more training." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Attitude toward AI failures in creative tasks

- "I would say it definitely doesn't hinder me too much because it invites me to engage in the creative process myself." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Self‑reported trust level

- "On average, how much do you trust the results… 3 - Moderate trust" — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Desire for seamless yet controllable integration

- "It would have to pretty seamlessly, like, be integrated into my daily life… not so intrusive as where it's constantly… I would need to be in control of that myself." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Automation of routine purchases

- "If it could automatically order groceries… that would be pretty ideal… a good mixture of, like, a reminder and automation." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Financial safety layer and double‑checking

- "Having something to double‑check is helpful… I still check my banking statement monthly, but being able to catch it right when it happens might help prevent it…" — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Need for interactive dialogue in AI interactions

- "The experience is a little bit different… there's a lack of feedback; it's just me talking into the void… I need something to bounce off of." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Preference for two‑way conversational flow

- "Having facts bombarded at you… it's information overload. If you don't get that beat to absorb what you have or if I have a question, you should be able to ask about it and have it come back at you." — *en_response_0015.txt*

### Complex question seeking

- "The most common types of personal tasks I use AI for are those where I'm asking complex questions that I don't want to type into Google because they're too specific and complex." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### Technical debugging assistance

- "I can paste snippets of code that aren't working or error messages, and I can talk through it with the AI, which can explain itself." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### Conversational advantage over traditional search

- "It allows me to talk through something without having to generalize the problem. Because in Google, if I have a very specific error, I have to search for something that can pull up a broad range of topics and then search through those articles to see if they address something similar." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### AI getting stuck / repetition

- "The problem with AI, especially with ChatGPT, is that I think it gets fixated on a few answers. If I try all those things and they don't work, it just starts repeating itself." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### Time trade‑off when AI fails

- "I'll probably spend a good fifteen to twenty minutes doing this because I feel like with most problems, it is significantly faster to spend fifteen to twenty minutes talking with AI than it is to even attempt to find it on Google." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### Desired idea‑tracking feature

- "I think if I had a perfect AI assistant, it would keep track of my random ideas throughout the day. Later, when I'm ready, it would sit down and walk me through all those ideas, breaking them down into game plans to achieve them." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### Memory aid motivation

- "I have a really bad memory, and AI doesn't, so it can keep track of those things for me. Honestly, it being AI rather than just a notes app doesn't make a difference." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### Vision of OS‑level integration

- "I think it's getting to the point where AI is probably going to be built into an operating system. ... It would be harder for it to access other apps, but it would definitely have access to those, and it could create events and track emails." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### Low‑pressure AI interview experience

- "It feels like there's less pressure. I get to think about my answers before I click record, which is nice." — *en_response_0019.txt*

### Perceived reduction of social bias

- "From a biased perspective, though, you're less likely to have any kind of bias when talking to someone. If there's a person I'm talking to, maybe I'd avoid saying certain things to not offend them ... But with this, I'm going to be exact. I'm going to say exactly what I want to say because you're a robot and you don't have feelings." — *en_response_0019.txt*
