    "Uses Claude as primary AI tool, replacing Google Search for a wide range of queries",
    "Queries Claude 8‑10 times per day, often with 6‑10 exchange turns per query",
    "Leverages Claude for personal tasks (movie times, parenting, DIY projects) and professional work (market research, peer‑review writing, security‑strategy analysis)",

  "pain_points": [
    "Privacy and data‑security concerns; worries that personal or corporate data could be used to train models without consent",

  "desires": [
    "Strong privacy safeguards: no training on user‑provided data, isolated conversation contexts",

  "unique_insights": "The participant uniquely blends heavy personal reliance on a single AI (Claude) for both intimate parenting advice and high‑stakes professional analysis, while simultaneously expressing deep unease about any future use of that personal data for model training. Their trust hinges not just on answer accuracy but on the AI's ability to self‑correct and retain context, yet they remain skeptical that any company can guarantee privacy as AI moves toward AGI. This juxtaposition of high daily dependence and profound privacy anxiety, plus the call for a strict ‘no‑training‑on‑user‑data’ rule, stands out as a distinctive perspective."
