  "unique_insights": "The participant treats AI as a low‑stakes, fact‑retrieval tool comparable to a search engine and explicitly refuses to rely on it for any task that requires deep understanding, expertise, or handling of sensitive data. Their trust threshold is absolute—only 100% accuracy would make them comfortable—highlighting a stark contrast with many users who accept occasional errors. Additionally, they critique the interview interface itself (keyboard sounds, double‑barreled questions), indicating that even meta‑experience with AI systems can affect user perception."
