  "key_behaviors": [
    "Uses AI (ChatGPT preferred over Gemini) for APA citation formatting and checking.",
    "Asks AI for terminology explanations and quick learning beyond simple Google searches.",
    "Leverages AI to craft resumes and cover letters using detailed prompts.",
    "Experiments with AI image‑generation for UX research prototypes, but finds results underwhelming.",
    "Uses AI about once per week for personal academic tasks.",
    "Avoids AI for school essay writing because assignments discourage it.",
    "Envisions AI automating participant‑recruitment screening and ranking.",
    "Wants AI to learn personal preferences over time without repeated prompting."
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "AI image‑creation tools do not meet quality expectations for research visuals.",
    "AI does not automatically show its sources, quotes, or reasoning; user must ask each time.",
    "Need to double‑check AI output for accuracy, especially in high‑stakes professional reports.",
    "Feelings of low trust for critical tasks; rating of 4/5 reflects cautious stance.",
    "Interview experience felt awkward because the AI assumed the participant was finished speaking during pauses.",
    "Simulated typing sounds during the AI interview were distracting."
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Provides clear explanations of why an answer is formatted a certain way (e.g., APA rules).",
    "Consistently delivers high‑quality output (ChatGPT perceived as better than Gemini).",
    "Shows citations, quotes, and timestamps by default.",
    "Transparency about the reasoning process builds confidence.",
    "Ability to verify and edit AI‑generated content before final use."
  ],
  "desires": [
    "AI should automatically include its work (sources, quotes, timestamps) without being prompted.",
    "Assistant should learn the user’s preferences upfront and adapt over time.",
    "Streamlined, proactive suggestions that anticipate needed detail (e.g., “I noticed you need timestamps, here they are”).",
    "Automation of participant‑recruitment screening to rank best‑fit candidates.",
    "Interview interface that lets the user signal when they are still thinking before moving on.",
    "More personal rapport at the start of AI‑driven conversations (e.g., brief warm‑up, clear timeline)."

  "unique_insights": "The participant treats AI as a potential \"voice\" for professional research reports, requiring the system to not only generate content but also automatically provide verifiable sources and reasoning. They desire an assistant that proactively learns and anticipates the level of detail needed (e.g., timestamps, quotes) without repeated prompting, and they see a clear productivity gain in automating participant‑recruitment screening—saving up to an hour per study. Additionally, the interview experience highlighted a novel need for a UI cue that signals when the user is still formulating thoughts, a feature rarely considered in standard AI chat interfaces."
