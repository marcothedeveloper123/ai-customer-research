    "Uses ChatGPT and Claude daily for personal tasks",
    "Employs AI as a thinking partner to get perspective on many topics",
    "Feeds drafts of emails, texts, work documents, and even book chapters to AI for editing",
    "Iteratively edits AI output, often multiple rounds before finalizing",
    "Uses AI to summarize large amounts of publicly‑available data instead of consulting many people",
    "Attempts to use AI for emotional support when a human is unavailable",
    "Wishes AI could handle physical errands and household chores"

  "pain_points": [
    "AI edits are often imperfect, requiring the user to make manual changes (“I don’t like to tell the AI what to change because it doesn’t always get it right”)",
    "Conversational AI feels unsatisfying for emotional support – it “overdoes it” and talks too fast, lacking human nuance",
    "Low overall trust in AI suggestions (rated 2 – Low trust)",
    "Privacy and security concerns about giving AI access to logins, passwords, or credit‑card information",
    "Voice‑only interview format feels unnatural and disjointed; AI cuts off or doesn’t pause long enough"
  ],
  "trust_factors": [
    "Strong need for privacy and data security (“it should be like a Google robot with liability measures built in… that it won’t share my data with others”)",
    "Desire for clear liability guarantees from the provider",
    "Low trust in AI output despite frequent use"
  ],
  "desires": [
    "An AI assistant that can perform physical tasks – run errands, clean the house, do laundry – to free up time for family",
    "Seamless integration with existing tools (calendar, email, inbox) to automate manual chores",
    "Better conversational flow: slower speech, appropriate pauses, more natural turn‑taking",
    "A voice module that can read questions aloud naturally and avoid cutting the user off",
    "Improved emotional‑support capability that feels less “clunky”"

  "unique_insights": "The participant heavily relies on AI for routine cognitive tasks (writing, data summarization) and treats it as a scalable substitute for consulting multiple human experts, yet still rates trust very low and refuses to grant it deep access to personal accounts. Their vision of an ideal assistant extends beyond software to embodied robotics that handle household chores, explicitly to protect time for family connection—a motivation that links task automation directly to emotional wellbeing rather than productivity alone."
